# Lesson 2: The Different Kinds of Attention

## Lesson Objective

Children will identify three types of attention—sustained (staying focused on one thing), selective (blocking out distractions), and shifting (moving focus when needed)—and recognize when and why each one is useful. They will explore how these different "spotlight modes" help them in daily activities.

---

## Warm-Up (5 minutes)

**Activity: "Three Spotlight Moves" (hard copy materials + demonstration)**

Set up three simple 1-minute scenarios in quick succession, each highlighting a different attention type without naming it yet:

- **Sustained:** Announce a 60-second silent drawing challenge: "Draw as many dots as you can. Keep your spotlight on the paper the whole time." Time them. Count the dots together at end.  
- **Selective:** Play a simple children's song softly while giving verbal instructions in a normal voice (slightly competing stimuli): "While the music plays, follow MY voice. I'm going to tell you to touch your nose, then your ear, then your knee." Give 3 instructions. See who follows the instructions despite the music.  
- **Shifting:** Call out a quick game: "Everyone sit. When I say 'Go,' run to the window. When I clap once, stop. When I clap twice, come back to your seat. Go!" Execute the sequence.

After all three, ask: "Did you notice your attention was doing different things in each game? In the first, it stayed on one thing. In the second, it had to block out the music and listen to me. In the third, it had to jump around to different tasks. Today we're learning there are different kinds of attention!"

## Explore + Practice (30 minutes)

### Explore: Three Types of Attention—Video Introduction (7 minutes)

**Video + Teacher-Led Framing (media)**

Show video: "Paying Attention | Story Time For Little Learners" (2:45)  
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ0V3G7TtEE  

**Note:** This video is indicative only. In the full MindMaster version, a modified or copyright-free video will be produced or featured to illustrate the same concept.

**Rationale:** Narrative-based story that shows a character in different situations where attention works differently; reinforces learning through storytelling. 

After video, use teacher-led guided questions to surface the three types:
- "What was the character paying attention to in the first part?" (Building blocks—staying on one task = sustained)  
- "What happened when someone tried to distract them?" (They had to keep attention on the blocks despite the noise = selective)  
- "Then what changed?" (They had to stop blocks and listen to an instruction = shifting)  

**Teacher language:** "Good scientists notice patterns. The character's spotlight worked in three different ways. Let's give them names."

### Practice A: Matching Attention Types to Real Life (10 minutes)

**MindMaster Game: Attention Type Selector**

This game asks children to identify which type of attention (sustained, selective, or shifting) is needed for different scenarios.

**Game Format:** Matching / Categorization (Drag-to-Category style)

**Game Flow:**
- **Setup:** Explain: "I'm going to describe things kids do in a classroom. For each one, you decide: Is this SUSTAINED attention (staying on one thing), SELECTIVE attention (blocking distractions), or SHIFTING attention (moving focus to something new)? Use buttons 1, 2, or 3 to choose."  
- **Play:** 8 scenarios presented one at a time, each with accompanying simple illustration. 4 seconds per scenario to respond.  
   1. Finishing a puzzle while others play nearby. (Sustained – 1)  
   2. Listening to the teacher even though friends are whispering. (Selective – 2)  
   3. Playing a game, then stopping to hear instructions. (Shifting – 3)  
   4. Drawing a picture for the whole lesson time. (Sustained – 1)  
   5. Hearing your name called out and looking at the teacher. (Shifting – 3)  
   6. Eating snack while the teacher talks, still understanding the words. (Selective – 2)  
   7. Doing homework and keeping attention on it until finished. (Sustained – 1)  
   8. Reading a book quietly even though the TV is on in the room. (Selective – 2)  
- **Scoring:** 1 point per correct match. Visual feedback (thumbs up or gentle prompt). Cumulative score shown out of 8.  
- **Win Condition:** Score of 6+ = "Attention Type Expert."

**Relationship to Lesson:** This game is the core practice activity. It reinforces the three types through active categorization and real-world examples. Positioned mid-lesson after video to transition understanding into application.

### Practice B: Spotlight Modes in Action—Observation Task (10 minutes)

**In-Class Psychology Experiment: Personal Attention Type Observation**

Set up three quick micro-tasks (≤2 min each), one for each attention type. Children rotate through (or all do the same one depending on class size). After each task, they note which type of attention they used on a simple worksheet with three columns (Sustained / Selective / Shifting) with tick boxes.

**Task 1 (Sustained):** Copy a 10-word sentence neatly on paper. Note: No distractions planned.  
**Task 2 (Selective):** Listen to a story read aloud while a second adult makes small distracting sounds (tapping a pencil, rustling paper) in the background. Then answer 2 questions about the story.  
**Task 3 (Shifting):** Follow a series of 5 quick, changing instructions: "Put your hand on your head. Now touch your toes. Now clap. Now sit. Now stand."  

After completing tasks, debrief: "What did you notice? How did your spotlight feel different in each one? Which was hardest? Why?"

---

## Reflection (5 minutes)

**MindMaster Reflection Activity (digital reflection with clickers)**

Pose three quick reflection questions via MindMaster, each using a simple Yes/No or A/B format:
1. "Did you learn something new about attention today?" (Yes / No)  
2. "Which type of attention do you use most in the classroom—sustained, selective, or shifting?" (Buttons 1, 2, or 3)  
3. "Do you think practicing these different types of attention would make you better at schoolwork?" (Yes / No)  

Display responses as a class aggregate (e.g., "7 kids said Yes, 2 said No"). Affirm the learning: "Scientists ask questions and collect data. You just did what scientists do!"

## Home Prep (5 minutes)

**Preparation for Lesson 3**

Explain: "Next lesson, we're going to learn how to make our attention stronger—like exercising a muscle. Before we do that, I want you to try something at home. Pick one of the three types of attention we learned—sustained, selective, or shifting. Try to practice it on purpose. For example, if you pick sustained, maybe you focus on one toy or one activity for a whole 5 minutes without stopping. Tell us tomorrow what you tried and whether it felt easier or harder."

Give a take-home card with three simple icons (a clock for sustained, earplugs for selective, arrows for shifting) and write the example above so family members can help support the task.

---

## Connection to Unit Arc

Lesson 1 → Lesson 2 → Lesson 3: Lesson 1 taught attention as a single skill (the spotlight). Lesson 2 revealed that the spotlight has three modes, each suited to different situations. Lesson 3 will teach children that all three modes can be trained and strengthened—i.e., the muscle metaphor. Understanding what the three types are is essential before learning how to improve them.
