> Jump to: [Setup](#setup) · [Play](#play) · [Scoring](#scoring) · [Win Condition](#win-condition) · [Continuity Note](#continuity-note)

### Learning Objective
Children will understand attention as the mind's spotlight that selects what to notice and think about. They will recognize when their attention is focused versus when it wanders, and understand that attention is a skill that can be observed and improved.

### Game Purpose
This game provides hands-on experience with attention as selective focus. By searching for specific targets in busy scenes while ignoring distractors, children experience how attention acts like a spotlight—illuminating what we're looking for while leaving everything else in shadow. Success requires maintaining focus on the search goal despite visual complexity.

### Estimated Play Time
8–10 minutes  
- Tutorial: 30 seconds  
- 5 scenes × 75 seconds average (~6 min)

### Setup
**Opening Screen:**
- Title: *"Spotlight Search"*

### Continuity Note
This game introduces the foundational spotlight metaphor from Lesson 1 through direct experience. Players physically "shine" their attention on specific targets while ignoring distractors, making the abstract concept concrete. Success depends on maintaining selective focus—the core attention skill. This prepares for Lesson 2 by demonstrating that attention can be directed purposefully (laying groundwork for understanding different attention “modes”).

## Home Game 1B – Pattern Keeper
> Jump to: [Setup](#setup-1) · [Play](#play-1) · [Scoring](#scoring-1) · [Win Condition](#win-condition-1) · [Continuity Note](#continuity-note-1)

### Learning Objective
Children will distinguish between strong attention (spotlight focused) and wandering attention (spotlight drifting), and recognize what it feels like when their attention is focused versus when it wanders.

### Game File Name & Format
`hg-03.01-02.html` — Simon Says / Repeat the Pattern

### Game Purpose
This game demonstrates the direct relationship between attention strength and performance. By requiring players to hold sequences in memory and reproduce them accurately, children experience how focused attention (“keeping the spotlight steady”) leads to success, while wandering attention leads to errors. The progressive difficulty shows that attention can be challenged and strengthened through practice.

### Estimated Play Time
7–9 minutes  
- Tutorial: 45 seconds  
- 15 rounds × ~20 seconds average (display + recall + feedback): ~300 seconds (5 min)  
- Optional retries: +60–90 seconds  
- End screen review: variable  
- Replay extends time  

---

### Setup
**Opening Screen:**
- Title: *“Pattern Keeper”*  
- Visual: Character “Kai the Pattern Master” (cartoon robot/magician hybrid) surrounded by glowing orbs  
- Kai says: *“I’m going to show you patterns of lights and sounds. Keep your spotlight focused so you can remember and copy them!”*  
- Start button: “Start Patterns”  
- Background: Dark space with stars, focusing attention on the pattern display  

**Tutorial Round:**
- Visual: 4 colored pads (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow) in square formation  
- Kai demonstrates: *“Watch! The pattern lights up.”*  
- Simple 2-step sequence: Red → Blue (lights glow + tones play)  
- Text: *“Now you try! Tap the pads in the same order.”*  
- Player taps Red → Blue  
- Feedback: *“Perfect! You kept your spotlight on the pattern and remembered it!”*  
- “Ready for More!” button

### Continuity Note
This game extends Lesson 1’s spotlight concept by showing the direct link between attention strength and cognitive performance. Players experience how sustained focus enables memory and accuracy, while drift leads to errors. This experiential learning prepares for Lesson 2 by demonstrating that attention has measurable effects on success—setting up the understanding that different types of attention exist for different purposes.

## How Lesson 1 Fits into the Full Learning Arc

Lesson 1 introduces **attention as the mind’s spotlight**—the active process that determines what we notice, learn, and remember. The two home games transform this metaphor into lived experience: in *Spotlight Search*, children *direct* their focus to targets amid distractions (selective attention), while in *Pattern Keeper*, they *sustain* their focus over time (sustained attention).  

- **Lesson 1 (this document):** Builds awareness that attention can be observed, directed, and improved through practice.  
- **Lesson 2:** Differentiates between the three attention types—sustained, selective, and shifting—revealing the mind’s flexible “spotlight modes.”  
- **Lesson 3:** Strengthens attention as a trainable skill through goal-setting and focus strategies, promoting self-efficacy.  
- **Lesson 4:** Expands awareness to empathy—understanding that attention works differently for everyone and can be supported through care and respect.  

> 🌈 **Learning Arc Summary:** Awareness → Differentiation → Training → Empathy.  
> Through these stages, children not only *learn what attention is* but *experience how it feels* to control and strengthen it—building confidence in their ability to guide their own focus, and respect others’ different ways of thinking.
