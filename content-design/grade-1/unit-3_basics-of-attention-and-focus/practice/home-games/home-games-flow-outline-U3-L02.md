### Learning Objective
Children will identify the three types of attention—sustained (staying focused on one thing), selective (blocking out distractions), and shifting (moving focus when needed)—and match them to appropriate situations in daily life.

### Game File Name & Format
`hg-03.02-01.html` — Interactive Fiction / Choose-Your-Own-Adventure — Player navigates through a branching story as the character Maya, making choices about how to use attention in different situations. Each decision point requires selecting the appropriate attention type (sustained, selective, or shifting) to succeed in the scenario.

### Game Purpose
This game embeds the three attention types within relatable, narrative contexts. By experiencing Maya's day and choosing which attention type to use at each moment, children learn to recognize when each type is appropriate. The story format makes abstract concepts concrete through character-driven scenarios, building decision-making skills grounded in attention science.

### Continuity Note
This game builds directly on Lesson 2's introduction of the three attention types by embedding them in realistic daily scenarios. Through Maya's story, children see when each type is naturally needed, moving from abstract definition to practical application. The narrative format creates emotional engagement and memory anchors for each type. This prepares for Lesson 3 by demonstrating that attention types can be chosen strategically—setting up the idea that attention is a trainable skill.

## Home Game 2B – Focus Runner
> Jump to: [Setup](#setup-1) · [Play](#play-1) · [Scoring](#scoring-1) · [Win Condition](#win-condition-1) · [Continuity Note](#continuity-note-1)

### Learning Objective
Children will recognize which type of attention they're using during different activities and explain that the mind has different "spotlight modes" for different purposes.

### Game File Name & Format
`hg-03.02-02.html` — Endless Runner (adapted for attention training) — Player controls a character running through a dynamic environment where obstacles and targets require rapid switching between sustained focus, selective attention, and shifting attention to succeed.

### Game Purpose
This fast-paced game provides visceral experience with the three attention types in action. Unlike traditional endless runners focused on reflexes, Focus Runner explicitly labels which attention type is needed at each moment, building rapid recognition and application skills. The game demonstrates that skilled attention involves quickly choosing and deploying the right "mode" for each situation.

### Estimated Play Time
6–8 minutes  
- Tutorial: 45 seconds  
- 20 segments × 8–12 seconds each: ~200 seconds (3–4 min)  
- Transitions and feedback: ~60 seconds  
- End screen: variable  
- Replay with different sequences extends engagement  

---

### Setup
**Opening Screen:**  
- Title: "Focus Runner"  
- Visual: Character "Rio the Runner" (energetic cartoon child athlete) at starting line  
- Text: "I'm running through Focus City! I'll need to use all three attention types to make it through. Help me choose the right one fast!"  
- Three attention mode indicators shown:  
  🟢 SUSTAINED MODE: "Stay locked on target"  
  🔵 SELECTIVE MODE: "Block distractions"  
  🟠 SHIFTING MODE: "Switch targets quickly"  
- Start button: "Begin Run"  
- Background: Colorful city street with cartoon buildings  

**Tutorial Level (30 seconds):**  
- Rio runs automatically (slow speed)  
- Text: "Watch for signals! When you see this icon 🟢, tap the SUSTAINED button and follow the target!"  
- Green sustained icon appears above Rio's head  
- Player taps green button (bottom of screen)  
- Target appears ahead (floating coin), Rio's attention locks onto it with spotlight effect  
- Text: "Great! Now keep following it until it disappears!"  
- Target moves straight ahead for 3 seconds, then vanishes with chime  
- Similar quick tutorials for Selective (blue shield appears, distractors appear on sides, focus on center path) and Shifting (orange arrows, multiple targets appear in sequence, switch between them)  
- "Ready to Run!" button  

---

### Play
**Core Mechanics:**

**Automatic Running:**  
- Rio runs forward automatically at moderate speed  
- Player does NOT control left/right movement or jumping  
- Player ONLY controls which attention mode Rio uses  
- Camera follows Rio from behind/side angle  

**Three Attention Mode Buttons:**  
- Always visible at bottom of screen:  
  🟢 SUSTAINED (left)  
  🔵 SELECTIVE (center)  
  🟠 SHIFTING (right)  
- Large, tap-friendly (100×100px each)  
- Current active mode glows  

**Challenge Segments:**  
Game presents 15–20 challenge segments in sequence, each requiring a specific attention mode:

**SUSTAINED CHALLENGES:**  
Signal: Green icon appears above Rio with text "STAY FOCUSED!"  
Challenge: A target (star, coin, balloon) appears ahead and moves in a wavy path  
Task: Player activates SUSTAINED mode; Rio's spotlight locks onto target and follows it automatically for 5–8 seconds  
Success: Spotlight stays on target throughout → +10 points + target collected  
Failure: Wrong mode selected or mode switched mid-challenge → target missed, -5 points  
Examples: Following a flying bird, tracking a rolling ball, watching a moving vehicle  

**SELECTIVE CHALLENGES:**  
Signal: Blue icon appears with text "BLOCK DISTRACTIONS!"  
Challenge: Target path straight ahead, but distractors appear on both sides (flashing lights, moving objects, noises)  
Task: Player activates SELECTIVE mode; Rio runs straight with tunnel vision effect (sides blur/darken), ignores distractors  
Success: Reaches end of path without deviating → +10 points  
Failure: Wrong mode or hitting distractor → stumbles, -5 points  
Examples: Running through busy market with vendors calling out, playground with kids playing on sides, construction zone with loud machinery  

**SHIFTING CHALLENGES:**  
Signal: Orange icon appears with text "SWITCH TARGETS!"  
Challenge: Multiple targets appear in quick sequence (A appears for 2 sec, then B appears, then C)  
Task: Player activates SHIFTING mode; Rio rapidly switches spotlight between targets as they appear  
Success: Collects all 3–4 targets in sequence → +15 points (higher reward for complexity)  
Failure: Wrong mode or missed target → sequence incomplete, partial points  
Examples: Catching thrown balls from different directions, reading signs that appear and disappear, responding to people calling from different locations  

**Progressive Difficulty:**  
- Early segments (1–5): Clear signals, slow speed, one attention type per segment  
- Mid segments (6–12): Faster speed, quicker transitions between types  
- Late segments (13–20): Mixed challenges requiring rapid switching, ambiguous situations where player must decide which type to use (signal shows "?" instead of specific icon)  

**Decision Challenges (Advanced):**  
Some segments show "?" icon with scenario description but no prescribed mode  
Player must choose which attention type is best  
Example: "Three friends are calling you from different spots!" → Player decides (Shifting is best, but game accepts Selective if player explains they want to focus on one friend)  
Builds judgment and application skills  

**Between Segments:**  
- Brief 1-second breather with encouraging text: "Good focus!" or "Keep switching!"  
- Score and current segment number displayed  

**Visual Feedback:**  
- When correct mode activated: Rio's spotlight beam appears in corresponding color, smooth animation  
- When wrong mode: Rio stumbles slightly, screen shakes gently, loss indication  
- Success: Collected items sparkle, points appear with +10/+15  
- Failure: Items fade away, missed opportunity sound

### Scoring
- SUSTAINED challenge success: +10 points  
- SELECTIVE challenge success: +10 points  
- SHIFTING challenge success: +15 points (higher difficulty)  
- Decision challenge success: +20 points (requires judgment)  
- Speed bonus: +5 points if mode selected within 1 second of signal  
- Perfect segment streak: +10 bonus for 5 consecutive successes  
- Mode mastery: +5 bonus if player uses each mode correctly at least 3 times  
- Total possible: ~350 points (varies by number of segments)

### Continuity Note
This game provides dynamic, action-oriented practice with the three attention types introduced in Lesson 2. Unlike the story-based Game 2A which embeds types in narrative context, Focus Runner requires rapid recognition and deployment under time pressure. This builds fluency and automaticity. The game bridges to Lesson 3 by demonstrating that switching between attention modes is a skill that improves with practice—preparing for the training focus of the next lesson.

## How Lesson 2 Fits into the Full Learning Arc

Lesson 2 transforms students’ understanding of attention from a single “spotlight” into a **flexible system of spotlight modes**—sustained, selective, and shifting. The two home games bring this framework to life through complementary experiences: *Maya’s Day Adventure* embeds the modes in narrative decision-making, while *Focus Runner* turns them into quick, embodied choices. Together, they help children move from recognizing that attention exists (Lesson 1) to identifying *how* it operates in different real-world contexts.

By distinguishing between attention types and practicing when to use each, learners begin to see attention as something they can control and adapt—not just something that “happens.” This awareness lays the groundwork for Lesson 3, where they will train and strengthen their attention through deliberate strategies, and for Lesson 4, where they will appreciate that attention varies across people.

> 🌈 **Learning Arc Summary:** Awareness → Differentiation → Training → Empathy.  
> Through this progression, children evolve from *noticing their attention* to *understanding its types and uses*, building self-efficacy and preparing to treat focus as a skill they can intentionally develop and respect in others.
