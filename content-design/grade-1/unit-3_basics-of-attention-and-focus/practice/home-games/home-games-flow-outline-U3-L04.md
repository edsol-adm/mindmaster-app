## Home Game 4A – Focus Friends’ Day
> Jump to: [Setup](#setup) · [Play](#play) · [Scoring](#scoring) · [Win Condition](#win-condition) · [Continuity Note](#continuity-note)

### Learning Objective
Children will recognize that attention patterns vary across people and identify factors that influence attention for themselves and others (energy level, interest, noise, time of day). They will describe their own attention patterns and what conditions help them focus best.

### Game File Name & Format
`hg-03.04-01.html` — Life Simulation / Character Management

### Game Purpose
This game demonstrates individual differences in attention through direct experimentation and observation. By managing multiple characters with distinct profiles, children experience how the same condition (e.g., background music) helps one person but hinders another. The simulation format allows safe exploration of variables, building empathy and self-awareness through systematic comparison.

### Estimated Play Time
10–12 minutes  
- Character introductions: 90 seconds  
- Morning session: 3 minutes  
- Afternoon session: 3 minutes  
- Evening session: 3 minutes  
- Self-discovery: 2 minutes  
- Results review: variable

### Play
**Game Structure:** Morning, Afternoon, Evening Sessions  

**Core Mechanics:**  
Player helps each character complete focus tasks throughout the day. For each session, player chooses environmental conditions and observes results.

---

#### MORNING SESSION: Math Homework
**Task:** All three friends need to complete math worksheets  

**Setup Phase:**
- Text: *“It's morning! Sam, Ava, and Leo all have math to do. Let's set up the best workspace for each friend.”*  
- Split screen showing all three characters at their desks  
- Player selects conditions for EACH character individually  

**Condition Choices (per character):**

**Environment Options:**
- 🔇 Quiet Room (no background noise)  
- 🎵 Background Music (soft instrumental)  
- 🔊 Busy Room (classroom sounds)  

**Energy Options:**
- ☕ After Breakfast (well-fed and energized)  
- 😴 Still Sleepy (just woke up, low energy)  
- 🏃 After Exercise (just did morning run)  

**Seating Options:**
- 🪑 Sitting Still (chair at desk)  
- 🧍 Standing Desk (can move while working)  
- ⚽ Bouncy Ball Chair (allows fidgeting)  

**Work Simulation (15 seconds per character):**
- Character shown working on math  
- Visual “spotlight meter” shows focus strength  
- Animation reflects attention state:  
  - High focus: Steady work, spotlight bright, fast progress  
  - Medium focus: Some pauses, spotlight flickering, moderate progress  
  - Low focus: Looking around, spotlight dim, slow progress  
- Math problems completed counter shows results  

**Results & Feedback:**
- Each character’s performance displayed:  
  - “Sam completed 8/10 problems!”  
  - “Ava completed 10/10 problems!”  
  - “Leo completed 5/10 problems!”  
- Explanation tied to choices:  
  - Sam: “The bouncy ball chair helped Sam focus! He needs movement to keep his attention strong.”  
  - Ava: “The quiet room was perfect for Ava! She focuses best without distractions.”  
  - Leo: “Leo found math boring today. Even good conditions couldn't help much when he's not interested.”  
- Gems awarded: +5 per friend who completed 7+ problems  

**Learning Moment:**
*“Notice: The SAME conditions didn't work for everyone! Each friend has different attention needs.”*  
- “Continue to Afternoon” button  

---

#### AFTERNOON SESSION: Art Project
**Task:** All three friends are painting pictures  
Same structure as morning, but:  
- Task is art (high interest for Leo, lower for Sam, medium for Ava)  
- Player again chooses conditions for each friend  
- New option appears: Interest Level (player sees Leo is VERY interested in art)  

**Expected Results Pattern:**
- Leo excels regardless of conditions (high interest overrides)  
- Sam still needs movement  
- Ava still needs quiet

**Additional factor introduced: Time of Day Effect**
- Text: *“It's evening. Some people focus better in morning, others at night. Let's see!”*  
- Player chooses conditions again  
- Results show how energy levels change throughout day  
  - Sam: Lower energy in evening (unless exercised recently)  
  - Ava: Still focuses well  
  - Leo: Focus depends on book interest

### Continuity Note
This game is the experiential foundation for Lesson 4's concept of attention variability. By managing three distinct profiles, children observe concretely that identical conditions produce different results depending on the person. The self-discovery phase bridges observation of others to understanding of self. This prepares for Game 4B by establishing that understanding differences enables better support—knowing what helps each person allows appropriate helping strategies.

### Continuity Note
This game completes Unit 3 by synthesizing all four lessons into prosocial application. It requires:
- Lesson 1: Understanding attention as a spotlight that can focus or drift  
- Lesson 2: Recognizing different attention types (sustained, selective, shifting)  
- Lesson 3: Applying focus strategies (movement, refocusing, goal-setting)  
- Lesson 4: Respecting individual attention needs and matching strategies appropriately  

By helping diverse classmates and reflecting on themselves, children demonstrate empathy grounded in understanding that attention variability is a normal part of human diversity.

## How Lesson 4 Fits into the Full Learning Arc

Lesson 4 completes Unit 3 by transforming understanding of attention into **empathy-based application**. Through *School Helper Adventure*, children move beyond self-observation and strategy practice to recognize that attention looks different for everyone—and that helping others means noticing their unique needs rather than assuming what works for oneself.

Across the four lessons, learners progress from **awareness** of attention (Lesson 1), to **understanding** its types (Lesson 2), to **training** their own focus (Lesson 3), and finally to **respect and empathy** for attentional diversity (Lesson 4). By helping peers and reflecting on their own focus patterns, children internalize that there is no single “right” way to pay attention—only different ways that minds work effectively.

> 🌈 **Learning Arc Summary:** Awareness → Understanding → Training → Empathy.  
> By the end of this unit, children not only understand how attention functions but also appreciate how to support both themselves and others—fulfilling MindMaster’s theory of change: **knowledge builds self-efficacy, and self-efficacy fosters resilience.**
