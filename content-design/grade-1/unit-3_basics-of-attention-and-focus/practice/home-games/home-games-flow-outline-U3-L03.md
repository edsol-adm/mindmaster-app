## Home Game 3A – Attention Lab
> Jump to: [Setup](#setup) · [Play](#play) · [Scoring](#scoring) · [Win Condition](#win-condition) · [Continuity Note](#continuity-note)

### Learning Objective
Children will understand that attention is like a muscle that strengthens with practice. They will apply focus strategies (setting goals, using anchors, minimizing distractions) and experience measurable improvement through repeated practice.

### Game File Name & Format
`hg-03.03-01.html` — Virtual Experiment / Lab Simulation

### Game Purpose
This game provides empirical evidence that attention is trainable. By conducting controlled experiments with measurable outcomes, children experience the scientific method applied to their own cognition. The before/after comparison demonstrates conclusively that strategies improve performance, building self-efficacy through data rather than abstract claims.

### Estimated Play Time
10–12 minutes  
- Lab intro: 30 seconds  
- Baseline test: 90 seconds  
- Strategy training (3 stations): 4 minutes  
- Final test: 90 seconds  
- Bonus (optional): 90 seconds  
- Results review: variable

### Win Condition
**Scientific discovery completion:**  
- Complete baseline + strategy training + final test = Experiment complete  
- ANY improvement between baseline and strategy test = Success celebrated

### Continuity Note
This game is the scientific cornerstone of Lesson 3. By providing concrete before/after data, it transforms the abstract claim “attention is trainable” into lived experience. The lab format emphasizes psychology as empirical science. This prepares for Lesson 4 by establishing that while strategies help everyone, the degree of improvement varies—setting up the concept of individual differences in baseline attention and strategy effectiveness.

## Home Game 3B – Beat Keeper
> Jump to: [Setup](#setup-1) · [Play](#play-1) · [Scoring](#scoring-1) · [Win Condition](#win-condition-1) · [Continuity Note](#continuity-note-1)

### Learning Objective
Children will demonstrate the practice of noticing when attention drifts and gently bringing it back without self-criticism. They will recognize that focus improves through repeated practice.

### Game File Name & Format
`hg-03.03-02.html` — Rhythm Game (Focus Training)

### Game Purpose
This game teaches the metacognitive skill of monitoring attention state in real time. By requiring continuous rhythm maintenance while distractions occur, children experience what attention drift feels like (missing beats) and practice the immediate recovery skill. The rhythm format provides clear, non-judgmental feedback: you're either on beat or not, making attention state observable.

### Estimated Play Time
8–10 minutes  
- Tutorial: 60 seconds  
- 5 songs × 60 seconds average: 5 minutes  
- Breaks between songs: 50 seconds  
- End screen: variable  
- Replay extends engagement  

---

### Setup
**Opening Screen:**
- Title: *"Beat Keeper"*
- Visual: Character “Melody” (friendly musician with headphones, cartoon style) sitting with drum pad  
- Text: *"Hi! I'm Melody. I play drums by keeping steady beats. Sometimes my attention drifts and I miss beats—but I've learned to notice when that happens and jump back in! Want to practice with me?"*  
- Start button: “Let's Play”  
- Background: Music studio with instruments, warm lighting  

**Tutorial Level:**
- Visual: Large drum pad in center (circle, 150px diameter)  
- Melody: *"Listen to the beat and watch the circle. When the circle lights up, tap it!"*  
- Simple 4-beat pattern plays (♩ ♩ ♩ ♩ at 60 BPM)  
- Visual pulse: Circle glows on each beat  
- Player taps 4 times  
- Feedback: *"Perfect! You kept the beat. Now let's see what happens when distractions appear..."*  
- Second tutorial: Same beat, but small colorful shapes fly across screen  
- Melody: *"Did you notice? Your attention might want to look at those shapes! If you miss a beat, that's okay—just jump back in!"*  
- Player practices with distractions  
- “Ready to Train!” button  

---

### Play
**Game Structure: 5 Songs, Progressive Difficulty**

**Core Mechanics:**
- Beat Keeping: Song plays with clear percussion beat; visual drum pad pulses on each beat.  
  Player must tap in time with the beat.  
- Timing Windows:  
  - Perfect (±100ms) → full points, bright glow  
  - Good (±250ms) → partial points, medium glow  
  - Miss → no points, dim pulse  
- Distraction Events:  
  Visual objects, motion, text, and sounds appear to test focus.  
  Frequency increases each level.  
- Drift Detection Mechanic:  
  If player misses 2+ beats → *"Attention drifted? Refocus!"* appears; Melody encourages re-entry.  
- Refocus Success:  
  After a drift, hitting 3 beats correctly triggers *"Refocused!"* bonus (+5 pts).

**Songs:**
1. *"Steady Start"* – 60 BPM, 30 beats, 3 simple distractions  
2. *"Keep Moving"* – 70 BPM, 35 beats, visual + motion distractions  
3. *"Focus Challenge"* – 80 BPM, 40 beats, visual + motion + text distractions  
4. *"Drift & Return"* – 90 BPM, 40 beats, all distraction types + silent beats  
5. *"Master Beat"* – 100 BPM, 45 beats, frequent varied distractions and syncopation  

**Between Songs:**
- 10-second break  
- Stats shown: “Beats hit: X/Y”, “Times refocused: X”, “Focus strength: ★★★☆☆”  
- Melody encourages: *"Great work! Even when your attention drifted, you brought it back!"*  
- “Next Song” button  

**Progress Indicators:**
- Focus Meter: fills/drains based on accuracy (Green → Yellow → Orange)  
- Streak Counter: “Current streak: X beats in a row” resets on miss, teaching that drift is temporary.  

---

### Scoring
- Perfect beat hit: +10 pts  
- Good beat hit: +5 pts  
- Miss: 0 pts  
- Refocus bonus: +5 pts per drift recovery  
- Streak bonus: +2 pts per 5-beat streak  
- Song completion: +20 pts per song  
- Distraction resistance: +10 bonus if >80% accuracy under distractions  
- Maximum total: ~400 pts  

*Refocusing is rewarded equally to never drifting—recovery is part of mastery.*

---

### Win Condition
**Practice-based completion:**  
- Complete all 5 songs = training complete  
- Success = engagement + practicing refocus skill  

**End Screen:**
- Visual: Melody with instruments, focus meter full  
- Stats:  
  - “Songs Completed: 5/5”  
  - “Total Beats Hit: X/190”  
  - “Times Drifted: Y”  
  - “Times Refocused: Z”  
  - “Refocus Success Rate: [Z/Y]%”  
- Key insight messages (adaptive):  
  - High rate → *"Amazing! You noticed drift and came back every time!"*  
  - Medium → *"Great work! Every practice makes this skill stronger!"*  
  - Low → *"Good effort! Noticing drift is the first step!"*  
- Special message (always shown): *"Remember: Drifting is NORMAL. Noticing it and coming back is what makes your focus muscle strong!"*  
- Badge: *"Beat Keeper"* (levels based on performance)  
- “Play Again” button  
- “Return to Home Games” link

### Continuity Note
This game directly practices the Lesson 3 skill of metacognitive monitoring—noticing attention drift and refocusing without judgment. By making drift observable (missed beats) and recovery immediate (next beats), children learn that attention lapses are normal events that can be quickly corrected. This prepares for Lesson 4 by demonstrating that drift frequency varies (some songs/contexts are harder), setting up understanding of how personal and environmental factors influence attention.

## How Lesson 3 Fits into the Full Learning Arc

Lesson 3 transforms the understanding of attention into deliberate, self-directed practice. The two home games—*Attention Lab* and *Beat Keeper*—turn the concept of “trainable focus” into lived experience: children see measurable improvement and learn to recover attention gently and effectively. These experiences strengthen self-efficacy (“I can improve my focus”) and normalize fluctuation (“everyone’s attention drifts sometimes”).

- **Lesson 1:** Introduces attention as the mind’s spotlight.  
- **Lesson 2:** Differentiates attention types (sustained, selective, shifting).  
- **Lesson 3 (this document):** Demonstrates that attention strengthens through strategy, training, and metacognitive awareness.  
- **Lesson 4:** Builds empathy by recognizing that attention varies across individuals and situations.

> 🌈 **Learning Arc Summary:** Awareness → Differentiation → Training → Empathy.  
> Through guided experimentation and rhythmic practice, children move from *knowing about attention* to *actively training it*—a key bridge between understanding and empowerment that builds confidence in their ability to guide their own minds.
