## In-Class-Game 3A – Spotlight Speed Challenge

# LESSON 1: Attention - the Mind's Spotlight

### Lesson Link & Learning Objective

- Define attention as the mind's spotlight that selects what to notice from all available information
- Explain how attention determines what gets learned and remembered
- Distinguish between strong attention (spotlight focused) and wandering attention (spotlight drifting)
- Recognize that attention is a skill that can be understood, trained, and used

### Game File Name: icg-03.01-game01.html

### **Game Title: **Spotlight Speed Challenge****

### Game Format: **Reaction Time Challenge with Progressive Difficulty**

This format uses timed visual detection tasks that increase in complexity, measuring both speed and accuracy to demonstrate attention as an observable, measurable cognitive function.

### Purpose: This game demonstrates attention as the mind's spotlight through direct experience. Children practice directing their attention to target stimuli while ignoring distractions, experiencing firsthand how focused attention works and how it can be measured. The game provides concrete evidence that attention is selective (you can't notice everything at once) and variable (performance changes based on focus strength)

**Location in lesson arc**: Explore + Practice section, Practice A. Minutes 10-20 (after video, before worksheet)

**Pedagogical Justification**: Positioned immediately after the video on attention as selective process so students can experience the spotlight metaphor firsthand through timed detection tasks. Generates personal performance data (speed/accuracy) that validates the concept before worksheet activities require identifying focused vs. wandering attention in scenarios.

### Setup

**Opening Screen:**

- **Title:** "Spotlight Speed Challenge"
- **Character:** Friendly cartoon owl character named "Scout" wearing scientist goggles (will be reused in Lesson 3 game to connect lessons on attention as trainable)
- **Visual:** Scout holds a flashlight/spotlight beam
- **Instruction Text:** "Your attention is like a spotlight! It shines on one thing at a time. Let's test how fast your spotlight can find targets. Get your clicker ready!"

**Pre-Game Instructions (Screen 2):**

- **Visual:** Split screen showing:
  - LEFT: 9 mixed shapes (circles, squares, triangles) in various colors
  - RIGHT: Scout's spotlight highlighting one red circle with a glowing effect
- **Text:** "Watch the screen carefully. When you see a RED CIRCLE, press Button 5 as fast as you can!"
- **Practice Prompt:** "Let's try 3 practice rounds first."

**Practice Rounds (3 rounds):**

- Simple displays with 4-5 shapes
- 1 red circle clearly visible
- Feedback: "Great spotting!" or "Try again - look for the red circle"
- No scoring during practice
- After practice: "Ready for the real challenge? Your spotlight is warmed up!"

### Play

**Game Structure: 3 Levels with Increasing Difficulty**

**LEVEL 1: BASIC SPOTLIGHT (Rounds 1-5)**

**Round Setup:**

- Display shows 6-7 shapes arranged in loose cluster
- Colors: Blue, yellow, green, red

- Display time: 3 seconds per round
- Children must still press Button 5 only for red circles

**Increased Cognitive Demand:**

- Selective attention: Ignore red non-circles
- Sustained attention: Maintain focus despite movement
- Visual filtering: Block out distracting animations

**Feedback Loop:**

- **Correct within 2 seconds:** "Strong spotlight! Ignored distractions! +15 points"
- **Correct 2-3 seconds:** "Good focus! +10 points"
- **Pressed for red square/triangle:** "Almost! Remember - red CIRCLES only. Your spotlight almost had it!"
- **Missed:** "Distractions are tricky. Keep practicing your spotlight!"

**Level Transition (after Round 10):**

- **Screen:** Scout gives thumbs up
- **Text:** "Your spotlight is getting stronger! Ready for the final challenge?"
- **Button Prompt:** "Press any button to continue"

**LEVEL 3: SPEED SPOTLIGHT (Rounds 11-15)**

**Round Setup:**

- Display shows 10-12 shapes in complex arrangement
- Full rainbow of colors
- Target: 2-3 red circles mixed throughout
- Multiple distractors (red shapes, pulsing elements)
- **New challenge:** Display time reduced to 2.5 seconds
- Children press Button 5 for EACH red circle they spot

**Maximum Difficulty:**

- Tests sustained selective attention
- Requires rapid spotlight shifting between multiple targets
- High visual noise environment

**Feedback Loop:**

- **Found all red circles within 2 seconds:** "Spotlight expert! All targets found! +20 points"
- **Found all circles 2-2.5 seconds:** "Excellent attention! +15 points"
- **Found some circles:** "Good spotting! Found \[X\] of \[Y\] circles. +10 points"
- **Missed all:** "This one was very tricky! Your spotlight tried hard."

**Final Round (Round 15) - Special:**

- **Text appears before display:** "Final challenge! This one is the trickiest yet!"
- Extra complex display with 3 red circles hidden among 15 shapes
- Bonus points available: +25 for finding all within 2 seconds

- Level 2: 75 points (5 rounds × 15)
- Level 3: 100 points (4 rounds × 20, plus round 15 × 25)

**Scoring Philosophy:** Speed + accuracy demonstrates attention strength. Progressive difficulty shows that attention faces increasing challenges. Individual improvement data (comparing early vs. late rounds) demonstrates attention as trainable.

### Win Condition

**Completion-Based with Tiered Success:**

- **Complete all 15 rounds** = Game finished
- **Earn performance badge** based on total points
- **No failure state** - all attempts contribute to learning

**Success Metrics Displayed:**

- Total score (quantitative measure of attention performance)
- Accuracy percentage (quality of selective attention)
- Speed improvement (comparing early vs. late rounds)
- Badge earned (recognition of achievement level)

**Educational Win:** Children understand that attention can be observed and measured, that it improves with practice, and that it's selective by nature (can't see everything at once).

### Continuity Note

**Connection to Lesson 1:** This game extends the "attention as spotlight" metaphor introduced in the lesson warm-up activity. While the in-class warm-up used a physical frame to demonstrate selective attention with a static image, this game demonstrates the same principle through dynamic, timed challenges that require active spotlight control.

**Bridge to Lesson 2:** The three difficulty levels subtly introduce the three types of attention that will be explicitly taught in Lesson 2:

- Level 1 = Sustained attention (maintaining focus across rounds)
- Level 2 = Selective attention (filtering distractors)
- Level 3 = Shifting attention (moving between multiple targets)

Children experience these attention modes practically before learning their formal names.

**Connection to Unit Arc:** Establishes baseline understanding that attention is measurable and observable - a key principle for the scientific framework. The performance data (speed, accuracy, improvement) provides concrete evidence that attention is not mysterious but quantifiable.

### Estimated Play Time

**8-10 minutes**

- Setup & practice: 2 minutes
- Level 1 (5 rounds): 2 minutes
- Level 2 (5 rounds): 2.5 minutes
- Level 3 (5 rounds): 2.5 minutes

## In-Class-Game 3B – Attention Mode Matcher

# LESSON 2: The Different Kinds of Attention

### Lesson Link & Learning Objective

- Identify the three types of attention-sustained (staying focused), selective (blocking distractions), and shifting (changing focus)-and give one example of each
- Match attention types to appropriate situations
- Recognize which type of attention they're using during different activities
- Explain that the mind has different "spotlight modes" for different purposes

### Game File Name: **icg-03.02-game01.html**

### **Game Title: **Attention Mode Matcher****

### Game Format: **Interactive Scenario Sorting with Contextual Reasoning**

This format presents realistic scenarios through animated vignettes and requires children to analyze which attention type is being used, moving beyond simple memorization to contextual understanding and application.

### Purpose: This game builds deep understanding of the three attention types by requiring children to identify them in realistic, relatable scenarios. Rather than matching definitions, children must analyze what's happening in each situation and determine which attention mode would work best. This develops both recognition skills (identifying attention types in action) and strategic thinking (knowing when to use each type)

**Location in lesson arc**: Explore + Practice section, Practice A. Minutes 10-23 (after tutorial, before observation task).

**Pedagogical Justification**: Positioned after character tutorial to provide 18 practice scenarios for classification before students attempt the observation task in Practice B. Progressive difficulty (obvious → mixed → application) builds competence systematically, ensuring students can confidently categorize attention types in real-world observations.

### Setup

**Opening Screen:**

- **Title:** "Attention Mode Matcher"
- **Characters:** Three cartoon animal friends representing each attention type:
  - **Steady the Turtle** (Sustained attention) - wearing a headband, looking focused on a puzzle
  - **Focus the Fox** (Selective attention) - wearing noise-canceling headphones, ignoring distractions
  - **Swift the Hummingbird** (Shifting attention) - darting between flowers, alert and quick
- **Visual:** Three characters standing together with their icons above them
- **Instruction Text:** "Meet the Attention Team! Each friend uses their spotlight in a different way. Let's learn their special modes!"

**Mode Introduction Screen (Tutorial):** Shows each character with their mode explained:

**Steady the Turtle (Button 1):**

- **Icon:** Turtle with magnifying glass on one object
- **Text:** "Sustained Attention: Staying focused on ONE thing for a while"
- **Example animation:** Turtle building a tall block tower, concentrating the whole time
- **Key phrase:** "Stick with it!"

**Focus the Fox (Button 2):**

- **Icon:** Fox with ear muffs/headphones
- **Text:** "Selective Attention: Blocking out distractions to focus on what matters"
- **Example animation:** Fox reading a book while other animals play loudly nearby
- **Key phrase:** "Tune it out!"

**Swift the Hummingbird (Button 3):**

- **Icon:** Hummingbird with arrows pointing different directions
- **Text:** "Shifting Attention: Moving your spotlight to something new when needed"
- **Example animation:** Hummingbird playing, then stopping to listen when someone calls
- **Key phrase:** "Switch it up!"

**Instructions:** "You'll see different situations. Decide which attention mode is being used. Press Button 1 for Steady (Sustained), Button 2 for Focus (Selective), or Button 3 for Swift (Shifting)."

**Practice Round:** One example scenario with guided explanation before scoring begins:

- **Visual:** Child coloring for 10 minutes without stopping
- **Text:** "What mode is this? Think about it... The child stayed on ONE task the whole time. That's Steady the Turtle's mode - Sustained!"
- **Prompt:** "Now you're ready for the real challenge!"

### Play

**Game Structure: 18 Scenarios across 3 Difficulty Levels**

**LEVEL 1: CLEAR SCENARIOS (Rounds 1-6)**

- **Text:** "Maya works on her drawing for the whole art class. What attention mode?"
- **Buttons:** 1 = Sustained, 2 = Selective, 3 = Shifting
- **Correct Answer:** Button 1 - Sustained (Steady)
- **Feedback (Correct):** "Yes! Steady the Turtle knows: staying focused on one thing = SUSTAINED attention! +10 points"
- **Feedback (Incorrect):** "Not quite! Maya stayed focused on ONE task. That's Steady the Turtle's mode - Sustained attention."

**Round 2:**

- **Visual:** Child reading book in library, other children playing games nearby (shown blurred/faded), reader still focused
- **Text:** "Jamal reads his book even though friends are playing nearby. What attention mode?"
- **Buttons:** 1 = Sustained, 2 = Selective, 3 = Shifting
- **Correct Answer:** Button 2 - Selective (Focus)
- **Feedback (Correct):** "Exactly! Focus the Fox knows: blocking distractions = SELECTIVE attention! +10 points"

- **Question sequence:**
  - "What mode for the TOP situation (homework with TV)?" → Button press
  - "What mode for the MIDDLE situation (long puzzle)?" → Button press
  - "What mode for the BOTTOM situation (stopping at bell)?" → Button press
- **Correct Sequence:**
  - TOP = Button 2 (Selective - blocking TV)
  - MIDDLE = Button 1 (Sustained - long task)
  - BOTTOM = Button 3 (Shifting - switching to bell)
- **Scoring:**
  - All 3 correct: +30 points + "Triple Mode Master!"
  - 2 correct: +15 points + "Almost perfect!"
  - 1 correct: +5 points + "You got one!"
- **Feedback:** "You matched \[X\] out of 3! The TOP used Selective (blocking TV), MIDDLE used Sustained (long task), and BOTTOM used Shifting (switching to bell)."

**Scoring Philosophy:** Progressive difficulty with increasing point values rewards deeper understanding. The final multi-part challenge demonstrates mastery across all three modes. Score reflects both knowledge acquisition and application ability.

### Win Condition

**Completion-Based with Mastery Recognition:**

- **Complete all 18 rounds** = Game finished successfully
- **Earn performance certificate** based on accuracy and total score
- **No failure state** - all attempts are learning opportunities

**Success Demonstrated Through:**

- **Recognition skill:** Correctly identifying attention modes in scenarios
- **Contextual understanding:** Distinguishing between similar situations
- **Application ability:** Determining which mode would work best in new situations
- **Synthesis:** Final challenge requiring simultaneous classification of all three modes

**Educational Win:** Children can identify and name the three attention types, understand when each is useful, and recognize them in their own daily activities.

### Continuity Note

**Connection to Lesson 2:** This game directly extends Lesson 2's core content. While the lesson introduces the three types through video and teacher-led discussion, this game provides independent practice with immediate feedback across 18 diverse scenarios. The animal characters (Steady, Focus, Swift) provide memorable anchors that children can reference when identifying attention types in their own lives.

**Bridge from Lesson 1:** Lesson 1 established attention as "the spotlight." This game reveals that the spotlight has three modes - just as the lesson promised children would learn. The progression from "attention is selective" (Game 1) to "attention has three modes" (Game 2) mirrors the conceptual development across lessons.

**Bridge to Lesson 3:** By the end of this game, children have practiced identifying all three attention types. Lesson 3 will teach that all three types can be strengthened through training. This game establishes what the types are (recognition), preparing children to learn how to improve them (application).

**Connection to Unit Arc:** Deepens the scientific framework: attention isn't just one thing, it's a system with distinct, observable modes. This classification exercise mirrors how scientists categorize phenomena to understand them better. Children practice the scientific skill of classification while learning psychology content.

## In-Class-Game 3C – Focus Power Trainer

# LESSON 3: Training Our Focus

### Lesson Link & Learning Objective

- Explain that attention is like a muscle that strengthens with practice
- Apply at least two focus strategies during a task (goal-setting, anchors, planned breaks)
- Demonstrate noticing when attention drifts and gently bringing it back
- Describe what helps their personal attention work better
- Recognize that focus improves through repeated practice

### Game File Name: icg-03.03-game01.html

### **Game Title: **Focus Power Trainer****

### Game Format: **Progressive Skill-Building Challenge with Before/After Comparison**

This format uses a three-phase structure (baseline → strategy training → improved performance) to demonstrate the "attention as trainable muscle" concept through experiential evidence. Children experience their own improvement as scientific proof.

### Purpose: This game makes the "attention muscle" concept concrete through direct experience. Children complete attention tasks without strategies, learn specific focus techniques, then repeat similar tasks using those strategies. The measurable improvement provides scientific evidence that attention can be trained - not just told, but proven through their own data. This builds self-efficacy by showing children their capability to improve through practice

**Location in lesson arc**: Explore + Practice section, Practice A. Minutes 10-20 (after video, before mini-tasks/quizzes).

**Pedagogical Justification**: Positioned after neuroplasticity video to provide empirical proof through before/after experimental design. Students must experience their own measurable improvement and learn the three focus strategies in the game before they can apply them in subsequent mini-tasks or answer quiz questions about strategy selection.

### Setup

**Opening Screen:**

- **Title:** "Focus Power Trainer"
- **Character:** Scout the Owl returns (from Lesson 1 game) wearing a whistle around neck and holding a stopwatch, now acting as a "Focus Coach"
- **Visual:** Scout standing in front of a "Focus Gym" with attention-themed equipment (spotlight beam weights, distraction-blocking shields, anchor targets)
- **Instruction Text:** "Welcome to Focus Gym! Your attention is like a muscle - the more you practice, the stronger it gets! Today we'll train your focus power!"

**Pre-Game Setup Screen:**

- **Visual:** Scout pointing to a three-step training program displayed on a clipboard:
  - Phase 1: Test Your Focus (Baseline)
  - Phase 2: Learn Focus Strategies
  - Phase 3: Train Again (See Your Power Grow!)
- **Text:** "Just like athletes train their muscles, we're going to train your attention muscle! First we'll test your focus, then learn some tricks, then test again to see how much stronger you got!"
- **Button Prompt:** "Press any button when you're ready to start training!"

### Play

**PHASE 1: BASELINE TEST (No Strategies)**

**Introduction:**

- **Scout says:** "First, let's see how your attention muscle works right now. I'm going to test your focus in three different ways. Try your best, but don't worry about being perfect - this is just to see where we're starting!"

**BASELINE TASK 1: Memory Focus Test**

- **Setup:** "I'm going to show you 8 pictures for 20 seconds. Try to remember as many as you can!"
- **Display:** 8 simple objects appear on screen (apple, car, book, flower, ball, chair, sun, fish) arranged in a grid
- **Time:** 20 seconds viewing, then pictures disappear
- **Response:** Pictures shown again one at a time. Children press Button 1 for "I remember seeing this" or Button 2 for "I don't remember this"
- **8 rapid-fire yes/no questions:** "Did you see the apple?" (show apple) → press button, "Did you see the tree?" (show tree - was NOT there) → press button, etc.
- **Result Recorded:** Score out of 8 (correct identifications)
- **NO strategies provided - just raw baseline**
- **Feedback:** "You remembered \[X\] out of 8! Let's see that number again after training!"

**BASELINE TASK 2: Distraction Blocking Test**

- **Setup:** "Now let's test how well you can focus when there are distractions. Listen to the story, even though things will try to grab your attention!"
- **Display:** Scout reads a very short story (5-6 sentences) about a rabbit finding carrots in a garden. While reading:
  - Background shows moving animations (butterflies flying, clouds drifting)
  - Occasional "distraction" elements flash briefly (colorful sparkles, bouncing balls)
  - Total story time: 30 seconds
- **Response:** Two simple comprehension questions:
  - "What animal was in the story?" (Button 1: rabbit, Button 2: dog, Button 3: bird)
  - "What was the animal looking for?" (Button 1: carrots, Button 2: flowers, Button 3: friends)
- **Result Recorded:** Score out of 2
- **Feedback:** "You got \[X\] correct! Distractions are tricky. Let's learn how to block them out!"

**BASELINE TASK 3: Sustained Focus Test**

- **Setup:** "Last test! Can you keep your attention on ONE thing for a whole minute? Watch the screen and press Button 5 every time you see a STAR appear."
- **Display:** Screen shows slow-moving shapes (circles, squares, triangles) drifting across screen. Occasionally (8 times total) a star appears among them for 1 second
- **Time:** 60 seconds total
- **Response:** Children press Button 5 each time they see a star
- **Result Recorded:** Stars caught out of 8
- **Feedback:** "You caught \[X\] stars out of 8! Your attention stayed strong!"

**BASELINE RESULTS SCREEN:**

- **Visual:** Scout with clipboard showing bar graph with three bars:
  - Memory Focus: \[X\]/8
  - Distraction Blocking: \[X\]/2
  - Sustained Focus: \[X\]/8
- **Total Baseline Score:** \[XX\]/18 points
- **Scout says:** "Great job on your baseline test! Now you know how your attention muscle works right now. Time to learn some focus strategies that will make it STRONGER!"
- **Button Prompt:** "Press any button to start learning strategies!"

**PHASE 2: STRATEGY TRAINING**

**Introduction:**

- **Visual:** Scout in front of chalkboard with "3 Focus Strategies" written at top
- **Text:** "Focus scientists have discovered tricks that help attention muscles grow stronger! Let's learn three powerful strategies."

**STRATEGY 1: SET A FOCUS GOAL**

- **Visual:** Scout pointing to target/bullseye
- **Explanation:** "Before you start a task, tell your brain WHAT you want to focus on. Your brain loves having a goal!"
- **Example Animation:** Shows child thinking "My goal: Remember the pictures" with thought bubble, then successfully remembering
- **Scout says:** "Setting a focus goal is like telling your attention muscle exactly what exercise to do!"
- **Practice Prompt:** "Let's practice! Your goal for the next task will be: Remember as many pictures as possible. Say it in your head: 'I will remember the pictures!'"
- **Button Prompt:** "Press Button 1 when you've set your goal!"

**STRATEGY 2: USE AN ANCHOR**

- **Visual:** Scout pointing to an anchor symbol, then showing child looking at teacher's eyes or placing finger on paper
- **Explanation:** "An anchor is something you look at or touch to keep your attention from drifting away. Like an anchor holds a boat in place!"
- **Examples shown:**
  - Pointing finger at what you're reading
  - Looking at teacher's eyes when listening
  - Touching the page you're working on
- **Scout says:** "When your attention starts to wander, your anchor pulls it back!"
- **Practice Prompt:** "For the next test, you can use your eyes as an anchor - keep looking at the middle of the screen, even when distractions appear!"
- **Button Prompt:** "Press Button 2 when you understand anchors!"

**STRATEGY 3: NOTICE & BRING BACK**

- **Visual:** Scout showing attention as a puppy on a leash that wanders, then gently comes back when called
- **Explanation:** "Sometimes your attention WILL wander - that's normal! The trick is to notice when it drifts and gently bring it back. No need to be upset - just guide it back!"
- **Animation:** Shows thought bubble with attention drifting to a different topic, then child noticing ("Oh! My attention wandered!") and returning focus to task
- **Scout says:** "Great focus trainers don't have perfect attention - they just notice when it drifts and bring it back gently, again and again!"
- **Practice Prompt:** "For our final test, if you notice your attention drifting, just notice it and bring it back. That's all! No problem!"
- **Button Prompt:** "Press Button 3 when you're ready to try all three strategies!"

**STRATEGY SUMMARY SCREEN:**

- **Visual:** Scout with all three strategy icons displayed:
  - 🎯 Set a Focus Goal
  - ⚓ Use an Anchor
  - 🔄 Notice & Bring Back
- **Text:** "You've learned the three power strategies! Now let's train again and watch your focus power GROW!"
- **Button Prompt:** "Press any button to start training with your new strategies!"

**PHASE 3: STRATEGY-ENHANCED TRAINING**

**Introduction:**

- **Scout says:** "Now you'll do the same three tests again - but THIS time, use your focus strategies! Let's see how much stronger your attention muscle has become!"

**ENHANCED TASK 1: Memory Focus (With Strategies)**

- **Setup:** "Remember Strategy 1? SET A FOCUS GOAL! Your goal is: Remember as many pictures as possible. Say it in your head right now!"
- **Pause for goal-setting:** Screen shows "Setting my goal..." for 3 seconds with thought bubble icon
- **Display:** 8 NEW pictures shown for 20 seconds (different objects: tree, dog, cup, hat, star, bike, door, moon) arranged in a grid
- **During display:** Scout's voice: "Use your anchor - keep your eyes on the middle! If your attention drifts, bring it back!"
- **Response:** Same format - 8 yes/no questions about whether they saw each object (mix of real items and decoy items)
- **Result Recorded:** Score out of 8
- **Immediate Comparison:**
  - **Screen shows side-by-side bars:** "Before Strategies: \[X\]/8 → With Strategies: \[Y\]/8"
  - **If improved:** "WOW! Your focus power grew by \[difference\]! That's the muscle getting stronger!"
  - **If same:** "You stayed strong! Sometimes the muscle is already working well!"
  - **If lower (rare):** "Sometimes different tasks are harder - that's okay! The practice still helps your muscle grow!"

**ENHANCED TASK 2: Distraction Blocking (With Strategies)**

- **Setup:** "Strategy 2: USE AN ANCHOR! Keep your eyes focused on Scout while the story plays. When distractions appear, your anchor (looking at Scout) will help you block them out!"
- **Display:** Same format - Scout reads short story (different story: bird building a nest in a tree), same level of distractions (butterflies, sparkles, bouncing elements)
- **Scout's voice during:** "Notice those sparkles trying to distract you? Your anchor keeps you focused!"
- **Response:** Two comprehension questions about the new story:
  - "What animal was in the story?" (Button 1: bird, Button 2: rabbit, Button 3: squirrel)
  - "What was the animal building?" (Button 1: nest, Button 2: house, Button 3: garden)
- **Result Recorded:** Score out of 2
- **Immediate Comparison:**
  - **Screen shows:** "Before: \[X\]/2 → With Strategies: \[Y\]/2"
  - **Feedback celebrates any improvement or maintenance:** "Your distraction-blocking got stronger!" or "You stayed focused both times!"

**ENHANCED TASK 3: Sustained Focus (With Strategies)**

- **Setup:** "Strategy 3: NOTICE & BRING BACK! This test is one minute long. If your attention drifts, notice it and gently bring it back. You can do this!"
- **Display:** Same format - watch for stars among moving shapes, 8 stars total over 60 seconds
- **Scout's voice at 30 seconds:** "Halfway there! If your attention wandered, bring it back - that's using your strategy!"
- **Response:** Press Button 5 for each star
- **Result Recorded:** Score out of 8
- **Immediate Comparison:**
  - **Screen shows:** "Before: \[X\]/8 → With Strategies: \[Y\]/8"
  - **Feedback celebrates growth:** "You caught more stars! Your sustained attention grew!" or "You stayed consistent!"

**FINAL RESULTS & IMPROVEMENT SCREEN**

**Visual:** Scout standing with trophy and large comparison chart showing:

**ATTENTION MUSCLE GROWTH CHART:**

Task | Before | After | Growth

\----------------------|--------|-------|--------

Memory Focus | \[X\]/8 | \[Y\]/8 | +\[Z\]

Distraction Blocking | \[X\]/2 | \[Y\]/2 | +\[Z\]

Sustained Focus | \[X\]/8 | \[Y\]/8 | +\[Z\]

\----------------------|--------|-------|--------

TOTAL SCORE | \[XX\]/18| \[YY\]/18| +\[ZZ\]

**Performance Recognition (Growth-Based):**

- **0-2 points growth:** "Focus Builder" - Bronze muscle badge
  - "Your attention muscle is training! Even small growth means the strategies are working!"
- **3-5 points growth:** "Focus Trainer" - Silver muscle badge
  - "Nice growth! Your focus power is getting stronger with practice!"
- **6-8 points growth:** "Focus Champion" - Gold muscle badge
  - "Excellent training! Your attention muscle grew a lot!"
- **9+ points growth:** "Focus Master" - Platinum muscle badge with stars
  - "WOW! Your focus power grew tremendously! You're a master trainer!"

**Special Recognition:**

- **Perfect Post-Training Score (18/18):** "Perfect Focus Award" - Special diamond badge
- **Most Improved in Single Category:** Star notation on that category

**Educational Message:** "Look at your improvement! This is SCIENTIFIC PROOF that attention is like a muscle - it gets stronger with practice and strategies!

Remember: 🎯 Set a Focus Goal (tell your brain what to focus on) ⚓ Use an Anchor (something to look at or touch) 🔄 Notice & Bring Back (gently guide attention when it drifts)

Every time you practice these strategies, your attention muscle grows stronger. You have the power to train your own focus!"

**Scout's Final Message:** "Scientists discovered these strategies by testing what works. You just became a focus scientist too - you tested your attention, learned strategies, tested again, and saw the improvement! That's real science!"

### Scoring

**Baseline Scoring (Phase 1):**

- Memory Focus Test: 1 point per correct item (max 8 points)
- Distraction Blocking Test: 1 point per correct answer (max 2 points)
- Sustained Focus Test: 1 point per star caught (max 8 points)
- **Baseline Total: max 18 points** (recorded but not final score)

**Strategy-Enhanced Scoring (Phase 3):**

- Same point distribution as baseline
- **Enhanced Total: max 18 points** (recorded)

**FINAL SCORE = Improvement Delta (Growth Points):**

- **Growth Points** = (Enhanced Total) - (Baseline Total)
- Maximum possible growth: +18 points (if baseline was 0/18 and enhanced was 18/18)
- Realistic expected range: +2 to +8 points growth

**Bonus Points:**

- **Perfect enhanced score (18/18):** +10 bonus points
- **Showed improvement in all three tasks:** +3 bonus points

**Maximum Achievable Score:** 31 points

- Growth: 18 points
- Perfect score bonus: 10 points
- All-around improvement: 3 points

**Scoring Philosophy:** This game uniquely scores IMPROVEMENT rather than absolute performance, making it accessible and motivating for all skill levels. A child starting at 6/18 and improving to 12/18 (+6 growth) earns more recognition than a child starting at 15/18 and staying at 15/18 (0 growth), because the goal is to demonstrate that practice works. This builds growth mindset and self-efficacy.

### Win Condition

**Growth-Based Success Model:**

- **Complete all phases** = Game finished
- **Show ANY positive improvement** = Success demonstrated
- **Earn growth badge** based on improvement delta

**Success Is Defined As:**

- **Participation:** Completing baseline and enhanced tests
- **Strategy Learning:** Understanding the three focus strategies
- **Observable Growth:** Showing measurable improvement (even +1 point counts)
- **Meta-Cognitive Awareness:** Understanding WHY the improvement happened (strategies work)

**No Traditional "Win/Lose":**

- Even if a child's enhanced score equals their baseline (no numerical growth), they still "win" by completing the training and learning strategies they can use later
- Focus is on process (learning and applying strategies) not just outcome (perfect scores)

**Educational Win:** Children experience their own cognitive improvement through scientific methodology (test → train → retest), proving to themselves that attention can be strengthened through practice.

### Continuity Note

**Connection to Lesson 3:** This game operationalizes the "attention as muscle" metaphor from Lesson 3. While the lesson taught strategies conceptually (goal-setting, anchors, notice-and-bring-back), this game provides immediate experiential proof that those strategies work. Children don't just learn about strategies - they see themselves improve using them.

**Character Continuity from Game 1:** Scout the Owl returns from Game 1 (Spotlight Speed Challenge), now acting as a coach rather than just a guide. This creates narrative continuity: Scout helped children understand attention as a spotlight (Game 1), and now helps them train that spotlight to be stronger (Game 3). The character becomes associated with attention science across the unit.

**Bridge from Lesson 2:** Lesson 2 taught that attention has three types (sustained, selective, shifting). This game's three baseline tasks correspond to those types:

- Memory task = requires sustained attention
- Distraction task = requires selective attention
- Star-watching task = requires sustained attention with some monitoring Children apply the types they learned, reinforcing that connection.

**Bridge to Lesson 4:** This game establishes that attention can be trained universally - everyone can improve. Lesson 4 will then address that while everyone CAN improve, people start from different places and respond to different strategies. Game 3 shows "attention is trainable" (universal principle), and Lesson 4 will add "but it works differently for each person" (individual variation).

**Connection to Unit Arc:** Completes the progression: attention is selective (Game 1), attention has types (Game 2), attention is trainable (Game 3). The scientific method is embedded: observe (Game 1), classify (Game 2), experiment and test hypotheses (Game 3). Children are doing psychology science, not just learning about it.

## In-Class-Game 3D – Attention Pattern Detective

# **LESSON 4: Attention Works Differently for Everyone**

### Lesson Link & Learning Objective

- Recognize that attention patterns vary across people
- Identify factors that influence attention for themselves and others (energy, interest, noise, time of day)
- Describe their own attention patterns and what conditions help them focus best
- Demonstrate respect for different attention needs by adjusting behavior or workspace
- Apply self-awareness by choosing strategies or environments that match attention needs

### Game File Name: icg-03.04-game01.html

### **Game Title: **Attention Pattern Detective****

### Game Format: **Observation-Based Pattern Recognition with Personal Reflection**

This format uses scenario analysis to identify attention patterns across different people and situations, followed by self-reflection to build awareness of personal attention characteristics. Rather than competitive scoring, success is measured through pattern identification and empathetic understanding.

### Purpose: This game builds understanding that attention variability is normal and functional, not deficient. Children observe different attention patterns across scenarios, identify factors that influence attention (environment, energy, interest), and reflect on their own patterns. This develops both self-awareness (knowing what helps their attention) and empathy (respecting that classmates have different needs). The game frames individual differences as scientific observation rather than judgment

**Location in lesson arc**: Explore + Practice section, spanning Practice A and B.

Phases 1-2: Minutes 12-20 (~8 minutes)

Phases 3-4: Minutes 20-35 (integrated with Practice B)

**Pedagogical Justification**: Split placement necessary because lesson requires both external observation and internal reflection. Phases 1-2 positioned after video to build pattern recognition skills through observation. Phase 3 integrated with Personal Profile worksheet for self-assessment. Phase 4 follows because students need both others' patterns and self-awareness before applying empathy to social scenarios.

### Setup

**Opening Screen:**

- **Title:** "Attention Pattern Detective"
- **Characters:** Four diverse cartoon child characters with detective magnifying glasses:
  - **Maya** - Focuses best with quiet, sustained attention strength
  - **Jamal** - Notices many things quickly, selective attention strength
  - **Zara** - Attention varies by interest and energy, shifting attention strength
  - **Alex** - Focuses better with some background sound/movement
- **Visual:** All four characters in detective outfits (trench coats, magnifying glasses) examining different clues
- **Instruction Text:** "Everyone's attention works a little differently - and that's perfectly normal! Today you're going to be an attention detective, noticing patterns in how people focus best."

**Pre-Game Detective Training:**

- **Visual:** Detective's notebook page with "Attention Clues to Notice:"
  - 🔍 **Environment:** Quiet or noisy? Bright or dim? Alone or with others?
  - 🔍 **Energy:** Rested or tired? Calm or excited? Beginning or end of day?
  - 🔍 **Interest:** Loves the topic? Finds it boring? New or familiar?
  - 🔍 **Time:** How long focusing? Quick task or long project?
- **Text:** "Good detectives notice CLUES. These clues tell us what helps each person's attention work best. Remember: There's no 'wrong' way for attention to work - just different patterns!"
- **Button Prompt:** "Press any button to start your detective work!"

### Play

**GAME STRUCTURE: 4 Investigation Phases**

**PHASE 1: PATTERN RECOGNITION (Scenarios 1-6)**

Children observe scenarios and identify what attention pattern or factor is being shown.

**Scenario 1: Maya's Morning**

- **Visual:** Split screen showing Maya at two different times:
  - LEFT (8am): Maya at desk, bright-eyed, working on puzzle with intense focus
  - RIGHT (3pm): Same Maya at desk, yawning, puzzle half-done, looking tired
- **Detective Question:** "What factor affects Maya's attention the most in these pictures?"
  - Button 1: Time of day / Energy
  - Button 2: Noise level
  - Button 3: Interest in task
- **Correct Answer:** Button 1
- **Feedback:** "Good detecting! Maya's attention is strongest when she's well-rested in the morning. By afternoon, her energy is lower. That's a normal pattern! Scientists call this 'circadian rhythm' - our bodies have rhythms throughout the day."
- **Detective Note Added to notebook:** "Pattern Found: Energy levels change attention strength"

**Scenario 2: Jamal's Workspace**

- **Visual:** Two side-by-side scenes of Jamal doing homework:
  - LEFT: Quiet library, Jamal looking around frequently, fidgeting, work incomplete
  - RIGHT: Coffee shop with gentle music/chatter, Jamal focused and working steadily
- **Detective Question:** "Where does Jamal's attention work better?"
  - Button 1: Quiet library
  - Button 2: Coffee shop with gentle noise
  - Button 3: Both the same
- **Correct Answer:** Button 2
- **Feedback:** "Excellent observation! Some people focus better with a little background sound. Total silence can feel uncomfortable for them. Jamal's attention actually works BETTER with gentle noise. Everyone's pattern is different!"
- **Detective Note:** "Pattern Found: Some attention works better with background stimulation"

**Scenario 3: Zara's Activities**

- **Visual:** Three images of Zara:
  - Drawing her favorite animals: Super focused, detailed work
  - Math worksheet: Attention wandering, looking around
  - Building robots: Highly focused, creative
- **Detective Question:** "What helps Zara's attention focus best?"
  - Button 1: Subjects she finds interesting
  - Button 2: Only math
  - Button 3: It doesn't matter
- **Correct Answer:** Button 1
- **Feedback:** "Great detective work! Zara's attention is strongest when she's interested in the topic. When she's bored, her attention wanders more. This is true for everyone - interest is a powerful attention helper!"
- **Detective Note:** "Pattern Found: Interest makes attention stronger"

**Scenario 4: Alex's Duration**

- **Visual:** Alex at computer doing different length tasks:
  - 5-minute quick game: Highly focused, successful
  - 30-minute reading assignment: Starts strong, attention fading by end, taking breaks
- **Detective Question:** "What pattern do you notice about Alex's attention?"
  - Button 1: Alex focuses best on short tasks
  - Button 2: Alex only focuses on games
  - Button 3: Alex never focuses well
- **Correct Answer:** Button 1
- **Feedback:** "Smart detecting! Alex's attention is strong for short bursts but gets tired during long tasks. That's called 'attention stamina' - it's like how muscles get tired. Some people have longer attention stamina, others work better in short sprints. Both patterns are okay!"
- **Detective Note:** "Pattern Found: Attention stamina varies"

**Scenario 5: Maya's Social Preference**

- **Visual:** Maya in two studying situations:
  - Studying alone in quiet room: Very focused, productive
  - Study group with three friends: Distracted, talking more than studying
- **Detective Question:** "What does Maya's attention need?"
  - Button 1: Working alone
  - Button 2: Working with friends
  - Button 3: Doesn't matter
- **Correct Answer:** Button 1
- **Feedback:** "Perfect observation! Maya's attention works best solo. Some people are like this - social situations use up attention energy. Other people (like Jamal) might focus BETTER with friends around. Neither is wrong!"
- **Detective Note:** "Pattern Found: Social context affects attention differently"

**Scenario 6: Classroom Seating**

- **Visual:** Classroom seating chart showing different students' preferred spots:
  - Front row: Two students labeled "likes being close to teacher"
  - Back corner: One student labeled "needs less visual distraction"
  - Middle with friend: One student labeled "focuses better near familiar person"
  - Window seat: One student labeled "needs to look outside occasionally"
- **Detective Question:** "What does this show about attention?"
  - Button 1: Only front row students pay attention
  - Button 2: Different people focus best in different spots
  - Button 3: Seating doesn't matter
- **Correct Answer:** Button 2
- **Feedback:** "Brilliant detecting! Everyone has different attention needs. Some need closeness to the teacher, others need less distraction, some need familiar people nearby, some need breaks to look out the window. A good classroom respects all these patterns!"
- **Detective Note:** "Pattern Found: Physical environment affects attention differently"

**PHASE 1 SUMMARY:**

- **Visual:** Detective notebook showing all 6 patterns discovered with small icons
- **Text:** "You found 6 different attention patterns! Scientists study these patterns to understand how minds work. Remember: Different doesn't mean wrong. Every pattern has strengths!"
- **Button Prompt:** "Press any button to continue your investigation!"

**PHASE 2: FACTOR MATCHING (Scenarios 7-12)**

Children identify which specific factor (from a list) is affecting attention in each scenario.

**Factor Key Displayed:**

- Button 1: Energy/Tiredness
- Button 2: Noise Level
- Button 3: Interest
- Button 4: Time Pressure
- Button 5: Physical Movement Needs

**Scenario 7:**

- **Visual:** Student trying to read but keeps bouncing leg, wiggling, eventually stands up and reads while walking
- **Text:** "What does this student's attention need?"
- **Correct:** Button 5 (Physical Movement)
- **Feedback:** "Yes! Some people's attention works better when their body moves. This isn't 'not paying attention' - it's actually HELPING their attention! Scientists call these people 'kinesthetic learners.'"

**Scenario 8:**

- **Visual:** Clock showing 2:00pm, student after lunch looking sleepy during lesson
- **Text:** "What factor is affecting this student's attention?"
- **Correct:** Button 1 (Energy/Tiredness)
- **Feedback:** "Right! After lunch, blood goes to the stomach to digest food, which can make us sleepy. This is a natural body rhythm!"

**Scenario 9:**

- **Visual:** Student at art station making a sculpture, completely absorbed for 20 minutes
- **Text:** "What's helping this student's attention stay so strong?"
- **Correct:** Button 3 (Interest)
- **Feedback:** "Perfect! When we love what we're doing, attention feels easy. This student is in 'flow state' - when interest and attention work together perfectly!"

**Scenario 10:**

- **Visual:** Test situation, clock ticking down, student rushing and making mistakes
- **Text:** "What factor is affecting this student's attention?"
- **Correct:** Button 4 (Time Pressure)
- **Feedback:** "Correct! Time pressure can make attention feel scattered. Some people work better with deadlines, others need more time. Both patterns exist!"

**Scenario 11:**

- **Visual:** Classroom during announcement on loudspeaker, student trying to read but keeps looking up at speaker
- **Text:** "What factor is challenging this student's attention?"
- **Correct:** Button 2 (Noise Level)
- **Feedback:** "Exactly! Unexpected noise can pull attention away, especially for people with strong selective attention to sounds. This student needs quiet to focus best!"

**Scenario 12:**

- **Visual:** Student at beginning of school day, alert and ready, versus same student at end of long day looking exhausted
- **Text:** "What factor is affecting attention differently?"
- **Correct:** Button 1 (Energy/Tiredness)
- **Feedback:** "Yes! Attention uses mental energy. By the end of the day, that energy is lower. This is why difficult subjects are often taught in the morning!"

**PHASE 2 SUMMARY:**

- **Visual:** Detective's evidence board with 5 factor categories, each showing collected clues
- **Text:** "You identified how energy, noise, interest, time pressure, and movement all affect attention! You're becoming an expert attention detective!"
- **Button Prompt:** "Press any button for Phase 3!"

**PHASE 3: PERSONAL PATTERN DISCOVERY (Self-Reflection)**

Children answer questions about their OWN attention patterns. No "correct" answers - all responses are valid patterns.

**Introduction:**

- **Visual:** Mirror/reflection imagery
- **Text:** "Now it's time to investigate YOUR OWN attention pattern! Remember - there are no wrong answers. Every pattern is just information about how YOUR mind works best!"

**SELF-QUESTION 1:** "When do you focus best?"

- Button 1: Morning (when I'm fresh and rested)
- Button 2: Afternoon (after I've warmed up)
- Button 3: It changes / I'm not sure
- **Response (all accepted equally):** "You discovered a pattern! \[Response selected\] is when your attention energy is strongest. Scientists found that everyone has different 'peak focus times'!"

**SELF-QUESTION 2:** "What kind of environment helps your attention most?"

- Button 1: Very quiet
- Button 2: A little background noise
- Button 3: It depends on the task
- **Response:** "Important discovery! Your attention works best with \[response\]. Some people need silence, others need gentle sound. Both are normal!"

**SELF-QUESTION 3:** "How long can you usually stay focused on something you find interesting?"

- Button 1: 5-10 minutes before needing a break
- Button 2: 15-20 minutes
- Button 3: 30+ minutes if I really like it
- **Response:** "You found your attention stamina pattern! \[Response\] is your natural focus length. This can grow with practice, but everyone starts with different stamina!"

**SELF-QUESTION 4:** "What helps your attention most?"

- Button 1: Setting clear goals
- Button 2: Taking breaks
- Button 3: Moving around while thinking
- Button 4: Having someone work with me
- **Response:** "Valuable pattern! \[Response\] is a tool that fits YOUR attention style. Keep using it!"

**SELF-QUESTION 5:** "When is it HARDEST for you to focus?"

- Button 1: When I'm tired
- Button 2: When there's too much noise
- Button 3: When I'm not interested in the topic
- Button 4: When the task is too long
- **Response:** "Great self-awareness! Knowing what makes YOUR attention harder helps you plan around it. This is what scientists do - they notice patterns!"

**PERSONAL PATTERN SUMMARY:**

- **Visual:** Personalized detective report card showing all 5 self-responses compiled
- **Title:** "YOUR Attention Pattern"
- **Display shows:**
  - "My Focus Time: \[morning/afternoon/varies\]"
  - "My Best Environment: \[quiet/little noise/depends\]"
  - "My Attention Stamina: \[short/medium/long\]"
  - "What Helps Me: \[goals/breaks/movement/partners\]"
  - "What's Hard: \[tiredness/noise/boredom/duration\]"
- **Text:** "Look at your pattern! This is scientific data about how YOUR mind works. Everyone's pattern looks different, and that's perfect. When you know your pattern, you can use it to help yourself focus better!"
- **Button Prompt:** "Press any button to continue!"

**PHASE 4: EMPATHY APPLICATION (Scenarios 13-15)**

Children apply their understanding to help others or make adjustments for different attention needs.

**Scenario 13:**

- **Visual:** Classroom scene - You're working on a project. A classmate nearby keeps humming while working, and it's distracting you.
- **Question:** "What would an attention detective do?"
- Button 1: Tell them they're wrong for humming
- Button 2: Remember they might need sound to focus, kindly ask if they can hum quieter
- Button 3: Just be frustrated and don't say anything
- **Correct Answer:** Button 2
- **Feedback:** "Perfect empathy! You remembered that some people need sound/movement to focus (their pattern), AND you respected your own need for quiet (your pattern). That's using science to solve a real problem!"

**Scenario 14:**

- **Visual:** A friend says "I can't focus in the morning - my brain doesn't wake up until afternoon!"
- **Question:** "What do you say as an attention detective?"
- Button 1: "You're just being lazy"
- Button 2: "That's a real pattern! Your attention energy peaks later in the day"
- Button 3: "Everyone should focus the same way"
- **Correct Answer:** Button 2
- **Feedback:** "Excellent! You recognized their attention pattern as real and valid. This is called 'chronotype' - some people are 'morning larks' and others are 'night owls.' Both are real brain patterns!"

**Scenario 15:**

- **Visual:** You're the classroom helper. Where should you create a "Focus Zone" for kids who need extra quiet?
- Button 1: Right next to the door (high traffic)
- Button 2: In the back corner away from windows and doors
- Button 3: In the middle of the classroom
- **Correct Answer:** Button 2
- **Feedback:** "Smart detective work! You considered which space would have fewer distractions for kids whose attention needs quiet. You're using science to help others!"

**Scoring Philosophy:** This game uses completion-based and understanding-based scoring rather than competitive scoring. Phase 3 (personal reflection) awards points for participation because all attention patterns are valid - there are no "wrong" answers about how your own attention works. This design choice emphasizes that the goal is self-awareness and empathy, not competition or conformity.

### Win Condition

**Completion & Understanding-Based Success:**

- **Complete all 4 phases** = Game finished successfully
- **Earn detective badge** based on engagement and accuracy
- **Receive personalized pattern card** showing self-understanding

**Success Is Demonstrated Through:**

- **Pattern Recognition:** Identifying various attention patterns in scenarios (Phases 1-2)
- **Self-Awareness:** Reflecting on personal attention characteristics (Phase 3)
- **Empathy:** Applying understanding to support others' different needs (Phase 4)
- **Meta-Cognitive Understanding:** Recognizing that attention variability is scientific, not judgmental

**No Traditional "Win/Lose":**

- All children who complete the game receive certification
- Badge level recognizes depth of understanding, not superiority
- Personal pattern card is individualized - not comparable to others

**Educational Win:** Children understand that:

- Attention patterns vary normally across people
- Multiple factors influence attention (energy, environment, interest, etc.)
- They can identify their own pattern (self-awareness)
- Different patterns deserve respect and accommodation (empathy)
- Understanding patterns is scientific observation, not judgment

### Continuity Note

**Connection to Lesson 4:** This game operationalizes Lesson 4's core message: "Attention works differently for everyone, and that's okay." While the lesson explores these differences through class discussion and personal attention profiles, this game provides structured investigation of patterns across multiple scenarios, building both recognition skills and empathetic understanding.

**Bridge from Lesson 3:** Lesson 3 established that attention can be trained universally (everyone can improve). This game adds nuance: while everyone can improve, people start from different places and respond to different strategies. Game 3 showed "attention is trainable" (universal principle), and Game 4 shows "but it trains differently for each person" (individual variation).

**Completion of Unit Arc:** The four games create a complete progression:

- **Game 1:** Attention is selective and measurable (attention as spotlight)
- **Game 2:** Attention has three functional types (sustained, selective, shifting)
- **Game 3:** Attention can be trained and strengthened (attention as muscle)
- **Game 4:** Attention varies normally across individuals (attention diversity)

This mirrors the scientific method: observe phenomenon (G1), classify it (G2), test if it's changeable (G3), study individual variation (G4).

**Character Continuity:** Unlike Games 1 and 3 which used Scout the Owl, this game introduces four new diverse child characters representing different attention patterns. This design choice emphasizes that the focus has shifted from universal principles (Scout as single guide) to individual diversity (multiple characters with different patterns).

**Connection to Unit Learning Objectives:** This game directly addresses Unit Objective #5: "Apply self-awareness by choosing strategies or environments that match their attention needs" by having children identify their personal patterns and see how those patterns connect to helpful accommodations.

**Empathy & Classroom Application:** The empathy scenarios in Phase 4 prepare children for real-world application: they can now advocate for their own attention needs ("I focus better with...") AND respect others' different needs ("My friend focuses better with..."). This builds inclusive classroom culture grounded in scientific understanding.
