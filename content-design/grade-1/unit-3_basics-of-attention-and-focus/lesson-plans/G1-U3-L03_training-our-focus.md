# Lesson 3: Training Our Focus

## Lesson Objective

Children will understand that attention is like a muscle that strengthens with practice, not a fixed ability. They will learn and apply concrete focus strategies (goal-setting, minimizing distractions, using anchors, noticing drift and refocusing) and experience how practice improves their attention over time.

## Warm-Up (5 minutes)

**Activity: "Muscle Stretch" + Attention Parallel (hard copy + movement)**

Start with a quick physical warm-up: Have children stand and do 10 arm circles, 10 jumping jacks, then stretch their arms overhead. Ask: "How do your arms feel now? They're a bit warm and loose, right? We did that by practicing a movement, and our muscles got ready."

Now sit down and ask: "Did you know your attention is like a muscle too? It gets stronger when you practice using it. Today we're going to practice attention like we just practiced moving our arms—and we're going to see if it gets better!"

Provide a simple take-home metaphor sheet with a picture of an arm muscle and a picture of a brain, with a label: "Both get stronger with practice."

## Explore + Practice (30 minutes)

### Explore: The "Attention Muscle" Concept—Video (5 minutes)

**Video: How Brains Learn (media)**

Show video: "How Your Brain Works | Crash Course Kids" (3:15, cue to relevant section on practice and learning)  
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILiNVpwqJmA  

**Note:** This video is indicative only. In the full MindMaster version, a modified or copyright-free video will be produced or featured to illustrate the same concept.

**Rationale:** Explains neuroplasticity and learning through repetition in accessible terms; supports the "brain as trainable" metaphor. 

After video: "Did you hear what they said? When you practice something, your brain gets better at it. Your attention is the same. The more you practice focusing, the stronger it becomes."

### Practice A: Focus Strategies Demonstration & Application (MindMaster Experiment)

**Psychology Experiment: Focus Improvement Through Strategy (MindMaster App)**

This experiment has children complete two focus tasks—one without strategies, one with strategies—to directly experience how strategies improve attention. MindMaster tracks both attempts and displays improvement data.

**Experiment Design (MindMaster Game Flow):**

**Task 1: Baseline (No Strategy) — 2 minutes**
- **Setup:** Explain: "I'm going to show you a list of 15 words on the screen for one minute. Then I'll hide them, and you try to remember as many as possible. Don't use any special tricks—just try your best."  
- **Play:** Display list of 15 common objects (cat, ball, pencil, tree, shoe, cup, sun, boat, fish, lamp, key, apple, door, book, hat) for 60 seconds. Children look. List hides. 5-second recall window: "How many can you remember?"  
- **Response:** Children enter number using clicker (buttons 1–9 for quantities up to 9, or button 5 if 10+).  
- **Scoring:** Record number of words they correctly remember. Display score.  
- **Result:** This establishes a baseline for unfocused learning.  

**Instruction on Strategies: (2 minutes)**
Teacher explains and demonstrates:  
- **Strategy 1: Focus Goal** — "Before I show the words, I'll say: 'I'm going to try to remember 10 words.' Just setting that goal helps your brain focus."  
- **Strategy 2: Grouping** — "Words are easier to remember if we group them. Look—animals (cat, fish), things you wear (shoe, hat), things to sit on (chair, boat). Grouping helps your spotlight stay sharp."  
- **Strategy 3: Anchor** — "Find one word you really like and keep your spotlight on it first. Then move to others."  

**Task 2: With Strategies — 2 minutes**
- **Setup:** Explain: "Now we'll try again, but this time use the strategies. Set a goal. Look for groups. Find an anchor. Ready?"  
- **Play:** Same 15 words (or different set) displayed for 60 seconds, but this time teacher narrates the strategies: "Look for groups... find your anchor word... set your goal of remembering 10..."  
- **Response:** Children remember and enter count via clicker.  
- **Scoring:** Record score. DISPLAY IMPROVEMENT: "Last time you got [X]. This time you got [Y]! You got [Y-X] more! Your attention muscle got stronger!"  

**Debrief:** Ask 2–3 children to share: "What made the difference? What strategy helped you?" Affirm: "You're scientists. You tested strategies and found out which ones work. That's exactly how real scientists improve things."

**Relationship to Lesson:** This experiment is the scientific core—children directly experience how strategies improve attention performance, validating the "muscle" metaphor through data.

### Practice B: Focus Strategy Practice in Mini-Tasks (10 minutes)

**Hard Copy + In-Class Application**

Children complete three very short focus tasks (2–3 min each) using different strategies learned above. For each, they "train" their attention by applying a specific strategy and then reflect on ease/difficulty.

**Task 1: Focus Goal + Minimal Distractions (Hard copy—coloring/drawing)**  
"Color this picture. Your focus goal is: I will color it neatly and not look away until I'm done." Simple, outlined picture provided. Quiet environment. Timer set for 3 minutes.  
**Reflection:** "How easy was it to stay focused? Did your goal help?"  

**Task 2: Selective Attention + Anchor (Hard copy—word search or simple puzzle)**  
"Find all the hidden words. Your anchor is the first word (already highlighted). Keep your spotlight on one word at a time. Block out distractions (teacher makes quiet background sounds)."  
**Reflection:** "Did the anchor help? Was it easier than not having one?"  

**Task 3: Shifting Attention on Purpose (Hard copy—task switching)**  
"Do 2 minutes on Task A (copy 5 words), then I'll say 'Shift!' and you move to Task B (draw 3 circles). When I say 'Shift' again, go back to Task A. Practice moving your spotlight intentionally."  
**Reflection:** "How did it feel to shift on purpose versus accidentally?"  

After all three, gather: "You just practiced your attention muscle three times. You used strategies. Good work! This is how attention gets stronger."

---

## Reflection (5 minutes)

**Reflection Activity: Self-Assessment (Hard copy + discussion)**

Distribute a simple "Reflection Sheet" with three statements:
1. "Attention gets stronger with practice." (Circle: True / Not sure)  
2. "A strategy that helped me focus today was: ________________." (Fill-in)  
3. "I want to practice this strategy at home: (Circle one) Goal / Grouping / Anchor / Shifting."  

Children complete individually (3 min), then teacher facilitates a brief share-out: "Who found a strategy that really helped? What was it?" Affirm all attempts: "Every time you practice, your attention muscle gets a tiny bit stronger."

---

## Home Prep (5 minutes)

**Preparation for Lesson 4**

Explain: "We've learned that attention is like a muscle, and you can train it. But here's something important for next lesson: Not everyone's attention muscle is the same. Some people focus better on one thing for a long time. Others notice lots of things quickly. And your own attention can be different depending on how tired you are, how interested you are, and where you are. Before we meet next time, try one of the focus strategies at home and notice: Did it help YOU? Or did you need a different strategy? Tell us tomorrow what works best for your brain. You're becoming attention scientists!"

Provide a take-home card listing the three strategies with simple icons, plus a note: "What helps YOUR spotlight focus best?"

---

## Connection to Unit Arc

Lesson 2 → Lesson 3 → Lesson 4: Lesson 2 identified the three types of attention and when to use them. Lesson 3 teaches that all three types can be strengthened through strategy and practice. Lesson 4 will reveal that while all attention is trainable, people have different starting points and different needs—some strategies work better for some people than others, depending on individual differences and context. This prepares children to see attention variation as normal and adaptive rather than fixed or deficient.

### Psychology Experiment: Focus Improvement Through Strategy (MindMaster)

**Experiment Name:** "Attention Muscle Training: Before & After"

**Game Flow:**
- **Setup:** Explain: "We're testing whether strategies help attention. First, you'll try to remember words with no strategy. Then, you'll learn strategies and try again. We'll see if your focus got stronger!"  
- **Task 1 – Baseline (No Strategy):**  
   Display 15 common objects on screen for 60 seconds (e.g., cat, ball, pencil, tree, shoe, cup, sun, boat, fish, lamp, key, apple, door, book, hat).  
   List hides. Children have 5 seconds to recall how many.  
   Children enter number via clicker (1–9 buttons, or 5 for 10+).  
   Score displayed.  
- **Strategy Teaching (2 minutes):** Teacher explains and demonstrates Focus Goal, Grouping, and Anchor.  
- **Task 2 – With Strategies:**  
   Same 15 objects (or different set), 60 seconds display.  
   Teacher narrates strategies: "Look for groups... find your anchor... set your goal..."  
   Children recall and enter count.  
   Score displayed with improvement delta shown: "Last time: [X]. This time: [Y]. You improved by [Y-X]!"  
- **Scoring:** Improvement = success. Celebrate any gain as evidence of trainable attention.  
- **Win Condition:** Any improvement (even 1 more word) marks success. Affirmation: "Your attention muscle got stronger!"

**Relationship to Lesson:** Students experience focus improvement directly, connecting practice to performance data—building self-efficacy.
