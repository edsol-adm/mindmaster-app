# Grade 1 · Unit 3 — Basics of Attention and Focus

**Purpose**  
This unit introduces students to **attention as the mind’s spotlight** — the process that decides what we notice, learn, and remember.  
Through exploration, guided practice, and simple psychological experiments, students discover that attention is **not a single ability**, but a set of skills that can be recognised, strengthened, and adapted. They learn that:

- Attention works like a **spotlight**, selecting what matters from everything around us.  
- It has **different modes** — sustained, selective, and shifting — each useful for different purposes.  
- Focus can be **trained like a muscle**, becoming stronger through practice and strategies.  
- Attention **varies across people and situations**, and respecting those differences builds empathy and collaboration.  

By the end of the unit, children will see attention as both a personal strength and a shared classroom skill — something that can be improved through curiosity, observation, and kindness.

**Theory of Change**  
> **Knowledge** — Students learn that attention is the mind’s “spotlight” that selects what to notice and focus on. They become aware that attention has modes (sustained, selective, shifting) and that it can be directed and trained.  
> **→ Self-efficacy** — Through guided experiments and visible progress in focus tasks, students gain mastery experiences showing that attention improves with effort and strategy. They begin to believe “I can control where my mind goes”, the foundation of executive self-efficacy. 
> **→ Mental resilience** — By practising how to shift focus after distraction and sustain it through challenge, students learn to self-regulate their emotions and persistence. They experience small setbacks as opportunities to refocus rather than failures, building early cognitive-emotional resilience.  

This reinforces MindMaster’s progression from knowledge-for-empowerment to self-efficacy and resilience — helping students see their own minds as capable, trainable, and worthy of respect.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this unit, students will be able to:

1. **Define** attention as the mind’s “spotlight” that helps select what to notice, learn, and remember.  
2. **Distinguish** between the three types of attention — sustained, selective, and shifting — and give real-life examples of each.  
3. **Demonstrate** strategies to strengthen attention and manage distractions through short practice tasks.  
4. **Observe** how factors such as energy, interest, and environment affect their ability to focus.  
5. **Apply** attention-awareness skills to adjust their workspace or behaviour to support focus for themselves and classmates.

## Lesson Sequence
1. **L01 — Attention: The Mind’s Spotlight**  
   Understanding attention as the mind’s focusing system — what it is, how it works, and why it matters for learning and memory.  

2. **L02 — The Different Kinds of Attention**  
   Exploring sustained, selective, and shifting attention through examples and observation.  

3. **L03 — Training Our Focus**  
   Learning strategies to strengthen attention, notice distractions, and regain focus with confidence.  

4. **L04 — Attention Works Differently for Everyone**  
   Discovering that attention patterns vary across people and situations, and developing empathy for diverse focus needs.

## Digital & Interactive Components (MindMaster)
- **Psychology Experiments** – Interactive activities where students measure and observe attention in action.  
- **MindMaster Games** – Matching, sorting, and quick-response games reinforcing types of attention and strategies for focus.  
- **Quizzes** – Scenario-based comprehension checks for concept mastery.  
- **Reflections** – Digital clicker-based questions encouraging observation of personal focus habits.  
- **Teacher Dashboard** – Displays class participation data and attention experiment summaries for monitoring pilot classes.

## Connection to Curriculum Arc
Unit 3 builds on the foundation of **perception** established in Unit 2.  
While Unit 2 showed *how information enters the mind through senses*, this unit explains *how the mind chooses what to process and remember*.  
Students begin to recognise that:

- Focus is a **controllable mental process**, not a fixed trait.  
- Attention strategies enhance learning, concentration, and emotional regulation.  
- Respecting attention differences supports collaboration and mutual understanding.

This prepares students for future units exploring **memory**, **imagination**, and **emotion regulation**, deepening their understanding of how the mind works as a system they can shape and strengthen.
