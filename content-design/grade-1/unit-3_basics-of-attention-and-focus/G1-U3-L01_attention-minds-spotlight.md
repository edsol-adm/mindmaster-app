## Lesson Objective
Students will understand **attention as the mind’s spotlight** — the skill that selects what to notice and think about from all the sights, sounds, and feelings around them.  
They will explore how attention affects learning and memory, and recognise that attention can be strong or wandering depending on focus.

## Warm-Up (5 min) – “Spotlight Hunt”
**Activity Steps**
1. Display a large image of a busy classroom scene (children reading, playing, eating, a bird outside, a clock, toys on a shelf, etc.).
2. Give each child a small card with a 4 × 4 cm “window” cut-out.
3. Ask children to move their frame around the image to view small parts: “Who found the bird?” “Who can see the clock?”
4. Discuss: “Could you see everything at once, or just one part?”

**Teacher language**  
> “Your eyes just did what your brain’s attention does all the time — it picks one small spot to look at carefully.  
> Today we’re going to learn how your mind uses its own spotlight.”

**Materials:** large image, small paper “window” frames.

## Explore + Practice (30 min total)

### Part A – Understanding Attention as Selection (10 min)
**Psychology Video (Sample Placeholder)**  
**Title:** *How Do We Pay Attention? | Crash Course Kids*  
**Link:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbtmMJA_dYE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbtmMJA_dYE)  
**Length:** 3 min 42 s  
**Purpose:** Visual explanation of attention as a process using the spotlight metaphor.  
**Usage Note:** *Referenced for concept illustration only. Final version will use original or licensed content.*

**Guided Discussion**
- What did the video say attention does? → Helps us notice and focus on important things.  
- Can our brain pay attention to everything at once? → No—it must choose.  
- Why is that useful? → So we can learn, remember, and not get confused.

### Part B – Psychology Test (10 min) · “Attention Strength Test”
**Format:** MindMaster app · Clicker-based selective-attention game.

**Game Flow**
1. Students receive clickers.  
2. Instructions: “Look carefully! When you see a **different-colour shape**, press Button 5.”  
3. 15 rounds × 2 s each (5–7 blue shapes; 1–2 red targets).  
4. Immediate visual feedback (✓ for correct / gentle buzz for missed).  
5. Scores = accuracy + speed; leaderboard (optional class display).

**Teacher note:**  
> “Your attention had to work hard to find the different colour. That’s your spotlight looking carefully.”

### Part C – Self-Observation Task (10 min) · “Spotlight Focused vs Wandering”
**Format:** Hard-copy worksheet.

**Steps**
1. Provide a 5-min maze or dot-to-dot activity.  
2. While students work, occasionally say mild distractions (“Did you see the bird outside?”).  
3. Afterwards, students mark when they felt focused vs distracted on their worksheet (two columns – bright vs scattered spotlight).

**Teacher prompt**  
> “When I mentioned lunch, did your spotlight move? That’s called attention wandering. It happens to everyone.”

## Reflection (5 min) – “Noticing Our Spotlight”
**Discussion Circle**
- What is attention? (Describe it like a spotlight.)  
- Did you notice your attention today — when it was strong or when it wandered?  
- Why does attention help us learn better?

**Teacher affirmation**  
> “Good noticing! That’s what scientists do — they watch their own brains working.”

## Home Prep (5 min) – “Spotlight Observation at Home”
Explain:  
> “Next time, we’ll learn that attention has **different kinds** — like spotlight modes.  
> Watch someone at home (a parent, sibling, or pet). Notice: Are they focusing on one thing or many things?  
> Bring one example tomorrow — you’ll be doing what scientists do: observing!”

**Take-home Card:** picture of a spotlight + prompt “What was the spotlight looking at?”

## Connection to Unit Arc
- **Lesson 1 → Lesson 2:** Introduces attention as a single skill (the spotlight metaphor).  
- **Lesson 2:** Reveals that this spotlight has different modes (sustained, selective, shifting).  
- Understanding the spotlight is foundational to recognising its versatility and trainability.
