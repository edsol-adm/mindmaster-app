## In-Class-Game 9A – The Ripple Detective

**Lesson 1: Every Action Has an Effect**

### Lesson Link & Learning Objective

Students will identify everyday cause-and-effect relationships, recognizing that their actions create effects-sometimes immediately, sometimes over time-and that these effects shape what happens to themselves, others, and their environment.

### **Game File Name: icg-09.01-game01.html**

### **Game Title: **The Ripple Detective****

### **Game Format**: **Cycle Completer** (Experimentation & Cause-Effect category)

****Format Justification**:** Cycle Completer is ideal for Lesson 1 because it makes cause-and-effect sequences visible and concrete. Students observe incomplete action-effect cycles and must identify the missing stage, reinforcing their understanding that actions create predictable effects. This format directly models the scientific observation process central to psychology-as-science: students act as researchers identifying patterns in behavioral systems. The format's focus on completing sequences aligns perfectly with the lesson's goal of helping students recognize that every action has an effect, building foundational causal reasoning skills.

### **Purpose**: Students practice identifying cause-and-effect relationships by completing action-effect cycles, building recognition that actions predictably lead to effects in observable, systematic ways

### **Lesson Arc Location:** Practice B (approximately minute 20 of 45). **Positioned:** AFTER video introduction to cause-and-effect concepts and AFTER hands-on experiment stations where students physically observed immediate effects. BEFORE guided discovery of delayed effects

****Pedagogical Reasoning**:** This placement follows concrete → representational → abstract learning progression. By minute 20, students have:

- Physically experienced immediate cause-effect at experiment stations (concrete manipulation: dropped pencil falls, bell rings and sound travels)
- Observed basic action-effect pairs in video (visual modeling)

The game serves as a consolidation checkpoint-taking the scattered observations from multiple physical stations and integrating them into a unified understanding through systematic pattern completion. Students now apply their observational skills to identify missing stages in cause-effect sequences, moving from experiencing effects to predicting them. This middle positioning allows the game to bridge experiential learning (what they just did at stations) and conceptual analysis (delayed effects discussion coming next).

The Cycle Completer format is strategically chosen here because it requires active prediction rather than passive observation, preparing students for the next activity where they'll analyze delayed effects that aren't immediately visible.

### Setup

**Starting Screen:**

- **Background:** Bright science lab with cartoon lab equipment (beakers, magnifying glasses, observation notebooks)
- **Character Introduction:** Animated character "Dr. Ripple" (friendly cartoon scientist with lab coat and curious expression) appears

### Continuity Note

**Link to Prior Learning:** This game builds directly on Unit 1's three-part mind model (Thinking, Feeling, Doing), specifically focusing on the "Doing" component. Students now examine how the Action Player creates observable effects in systematic cause-and-effect cycles.

**Link to Future Learning:** This game establishes foundational cause-effect recognition that will be expanded in:

- Lesson 2: Understanding how repeated small actions accumulate into larger patterns (building on the delayed effect concept)
- Lesson 3: Using cause-effect understanding to choose actions intentionally
- Lesson 4: Recognizing that unexpected effects provide learning feedback

The immediate vs. delayed distinction introduced here becomes critical in Lesson 2's focus on accumulation over time.

## In-Class-Game 9B – Tiny Steps-Big Changes

## Lesson 2: Small Choices Make a Big Difference

### Lesson Link & Learning Objective

Students will understand that repeated small actions accumulate to create larger patterns and outcomes, and recognize that even small everyday choices carry real weight in shaping what happens for themselves, others, and their environment.

### **Game File Name: icg-09.02-game01.html**

### **Game Title: **Tiny Steps-Big Changes****

### **Game Format**: **Before & After** (Observation & Recognition category)

****Format Justification**:** Before & After is ideal for Lesson 2 because it makes accumulation visible through direct visual comparison. Students observe "before" states and "after" states following repeated small actions, building concrete understanding that small choices compound over time into significant changes. This format reinforces the scientific observation process: students compare initial conditions to final outcomes, identifying what changed and inferring the accumulation pattern. The side-by-side comparison makes abstract concepts like "accumulation" and "pattern building" tangible for 5-7 year olds. Unlike single cause-effect (Lesson 1), this format shows transformation over time-the core concept of Lesson 2.

### **Purpose**: Students practice recognizing how small repeated actions accumulate into larger visible changes by comparing before/after states and identifying the small action pattern that created the transformation

### **Lesson Arc Location**: Explore A (approximately minute 10 of 45). **Positioned:** At the BEGINNING of practice activities. Functions as the primary teaching mechanism for accumulation concepts. BEFORE video about environmental impact, BEFORE accumulation charts, and BEFORE role-play stations

****Pedagogical Reasoning**:** This early placement is intentional because accumulation over time is difficult to demonstrate physically in a 45-minute lesson (can't actually wait 10 days to see a friendship strengthen or a garden grow). The Before & After format compresses time, making the invisible visible.

By placing this game at minute 10 (Explore A), it becomes the foundational experience that all subsequent activities reference. Students first SEE accumulation through dramatic visual comparisons (messy room → organized room after daily tidying; single flower → garden after daily watering). This creates a concrete mental model that teachers can reference during later discussions: "Remember how Maya's room transformed in the game when she tidied a little bit every day? That's what we're seeing in this video about water conservation too."

The game must come early because it IS the lesson's core demonstration. Without actually waiting days/weeks, the Before & After visual format is the most powerful way to make accumulation comprehensible to young learners. All subsequent activities (charts, role-play, video) reinforce and extend what students experienced in this game.

### Setup

**Starting Screen:**

- **Background:** Bright park scene with a path winding through, small signpost reading "Pattern Builder Park"

- Students who score 10-14 points receive "Accumulation Spotter" badge
- Students who score 5-9 points receive "Change Observer" badge
- All students receive "Time Tracker" badge for completion

**No Penalties:**

- Incorrect answers don't lose points
- Focus is on learning patterns through comparison, not competition

### Win Condition

**Completion Criteria:** Students complete the game by analyzing all 6 before/after comparisons. There is no "fail" state-students progress through all scenarios regardless of accuracy.

**Success Screen (after Scenario 6):**

- **Background:** Park scene with completed path, Tracker standing at finish point with notebook full of observations
- **Display:**
  - "Pattern Builder Journey Complete!"
  - Footprint trail shows full path traveled
  - Badge earned displayed with animation
  - Summary text: "You discovered the power of accumulation! You learned that:"
    - ✓ "Small actions repeated = Big changes"
    - ✓ "Daily effort builds over time"
    - ✓ "Consistent kindness strengthens relationships"
    - ✓ "Everyone's small actions add up together"
- **Tracker's Message:** "Amazing work! You've seen how tiny repeated choices create huge transformations. Remember: YOUR small daily actions have real power!"
- **Key Insight Display:** "The Accumulation Formula"
  - Visual equation appears: "Small Action × Time × Repetition = Big Result!"
  - Animation shows this formula with icons
- **Navigation Button:** "Return to the Park" (returns to lesson-09.02.html)

### Continuity Note

**Link to Prior Learning:** This game builds directly on Lesson 1's cause-effect understanding. While Lesson 1 focused on single action → single effect, Lesson 2 shows repeated action → accumulated effect. Students now see time as a factor that amplifies small choices into larger patterns. The before/after format extends the "delayed effects" concept from Lesson 1 into understanding systematic accumulation.

**Link to Future Learning:** This game establishes the accumulation principle that will be critical in:

- Lesson 3: Understanding that choosing helpful actions (even small ones) matters because they accumulate
- Lesson 4: Recognizing that repeated mistakes also accumulate, making learning from them important
- Unit 10: Seeing how small cooperative actions by many people build team success

The visual comparisons students experience here create mental models they'll reference when making intentional action choices in Lessons 3-4.

## In-Class-Game 9C – The Choice Mapper

## Lesson 3: Choosing Helpful Actions

### Lesson Link & Learning Objective

Students will distinguish between helpful and unhelpful actions by analyzing their effects, learn to predict consequences before acting, and apply intentional action selection to choose behaviors that lead to positive results.

### **Game File Name: icg-09.03-game01.html**

### **Game Title: **The Choice Mapper****

### **Game Format**: **Decision Web** (Story, Choice & Narrative category)

****Format Justification**:** Decision Web is ideal for Lesson 3 because it makes the thinking sequence visible through mapped connections between choices and consequences. Students see how a single decision point branches into multiple possible outcomes, building understanding that actions can be chosen strategically based on predicted effects. This format directly models the cognitive process central to intentional action selection: considering options, predicting effects, and choosing deliberately. Unlike linear narrative formats, the web structure shows all possibilities simultaneously, helping 5-7 year olds visualize the relationship between their Action Player's choices and resulting effects. The format reinforces psychology-as-science by treating decision-making as an observable, learnable process of weighing alternatives-the core insight of Lesson 3.

### **Purpose**: Students practice the complete decision-making sequence-identifying goals, predicting effects of different action choices, and selecting strategic actions-by navigating visual choice webs that show how decisions create different outcome paths

### **Lesson Arc Location**: Practice B (approximately minute 25 of 45). **Positioned:** AFTER the thinking sequence has been introduced and modeled through teacher demonstration. AFTER in-class psychology experiment (decision tree) and guided role-play where students practiced with scaffolding. BEFORE the in-class quiz

****Pedagogical Reasoning**:** The game comes AFTER students have been explicitly taught the thinking sequence (What do I want? → Which action helps? → I choose that one) through teacher modeling and practiced it through guided role-play with support. This follows the "I do, We do, You do" instructional design.

By minute 25, students have:

- Seen the teacher model strategic thinking during warm-up and explore activities (I do)
- Practiced consequence prediction physically at decision tree stations (We do, embodied)
- Practiced with guidance in role-play scenarios (We do, scaffolded)
- NOW: Apply independently in game scenarios (You do)

The Decision Web format provides independent practice with immediate visual feedback in a low-stakes environment. Students apply the learned thinking sequence to novel scenarios without teacher scaffolding, but the web's branching structure shows them consequences in real-time, functioning as a digital coach. The visual mapping makes abstract decision-making concrete: students literally SEE how different actions branch to different effects.

This middle-to-late placement ensures students have the conceptual tools to engage meaningfully rather than guessing randomly. The web visualization consolidates earlier learning by making the "thinking before acting" process visible as a map of possibilities.

### Setup

**Starting Screen:**

- **Background:** Colorful decision-making lab with branching pathway diagrams on walls, compass rose on floor
- **Character Introduction:** Animated character "Guide" (friendly cartoon navigator with compass, map, and thoughtful expression) appears
- **Welcome Message:**  
    "Hello, Decision Maker! I'm Guide, and I help explorers think before they choose. Every choice is like standing at a crossroads-different paths lead to different places. Want to learn how to pick the path that gets you where you want to go? Let's map some choices!"

**First Interaction:**

- A simple web diagram appears: central circle (situation) with three paths branching out to three effect circles
- Text: "Look at this Choice Web. In the middle is a SITUATION. The three paths are different ACTIONS you could take. Each action leads to a different EFFECT. Your job: predict which action creates the effect you want!"
- Visual cue: Paths glow gently, inviting exploration
- Instruction: "Read the situation, decide what you want to happen, then press the number button (1, 2, or 3) for the action that will help you reach your goal!"
- Guide points to web: "Let's practice thinking before choosing!"

### Play

**Round Structure:** 5 choice web scenarios, progressing from simple to complex

**Scenario 1: Sharing Materials (Simple: Clear Helpful vs. Unhelpful)**

**Web Display:**

- **Center Circle (Situation):**
  - Image: Two children at art table, only one red marker available, both want to use it
  - Text: "You both want the red marker. What do you want? → To use the marker AND keep your friendship strong"
- **Three Branching Paths from Center:**

**Path 1 (Top Left):**

- **Action Circle:** "Grab the marker without asking"
- **Arrow leads to Effect Circle:**
  - Image: Other child looking upset, friendship damaged
  - Text: "Effect: Your friend is hurt and angry. Friendship is damaged. You get the marker but lose trust."
  - Icon: Broken heart

**Path 2 (Top Right):**

- **Action Circle:** "Ask to take turns: 'Can we share? You use it first, then me?'"
- **Arrow leads to Effect Circle:**
  - Image: Both children smiling, taking turns with marker, both drawing happily
  - Text: "Effect: Your friend agrees! You both get to use it. Friendship stays strong. Problem solved together."
  - Icon: Two hearts connected (CORRECT - achieves both goals)

**Path 3 (Bottom):**

- **Action Circle:** "Walk away without saying anything"
- **Arrow leads to Effect Circle:**
  - Image: You sitting alone without marker, friend using it, both looking sad
  - Text: "Effect: You don't get to use the marker. Friend feels confused. Both miss chance to play together."
  - Icon: Question mark

**Question Display Below Web:** "Which path helps you reach your goal: use the marker AND keep friendship strong?"

**Answer Options:**

- Button 1: Path 1 (Grab without asking)
- Button 2: Path 2 (Ask to take turns) ← CORRECT
- Button 3: Path 3 (Walk away)

**Student Action:** Press clicker button 1, 2, or 3

**Feedback for Correct (Button 2):**

- Path 2 highlights with bright green glow
- Arrow animates from situation → action → effect
- Green checkmark appears at effect circle
- Text: "Excellent thinking! You predicted that asking to share would help you reach BOTH goals. This is the thinking sequence in action: 'What do I want? → Which action helps? → I choose that one!' Your Idea Factory thought ahead, and your Action Player chose strategically!"
- Guide: "You mapped the best path before choosing. That's smart decision-making!"
- Points awarded: +3

**Feedback for Incorrect (Button 1 or 3):**

- Selected path highlights briefly in red
- Effect circle of chosen path pulses
- Text shows: "Let's trace this path: Your action → This effect. Does this effect match your goal?"
- Comparison shown: "Your goal was: marker + friendship. This path gives you: \[what actually happens\]"
- Guide: "That path doesn't lead where you wanted to go. Let's look at all paths again."
- Correct path (Path 2) highlights in green
- Animation traces: Situation → Ask to share → Both goals achieved
- Text: "The helpful action was: Ask to take turns. This path reaches your goal!"
- Points awarded: +1 (learning point)

**Scenario 2: Joining a Game (Simple: Immediate Social Effect)**

**Web Display:**

- **Center Circle (Situation):**
  - Image: Group of children playing ball at recess, you watching from sideline
  - Text: "You want to play the ball game. What do you want? → To join the game and have fun with others"

**Path 1:** "Run and grab the ball from someone playing"

- **Effect:** Kids are annoyed, tell you to give it back, won't let you play. You're excluded. (Broken ball icon)

**Path 2:** "Stand and watch without saying anything"

- **Effect:** Game continues without you. You stay on sideline. Lonely. No fun. (Single figure icon)

**Path 3:** "Walk over and ask politely: 'Can I play with you?'"

- **Effect:** Kids say "Sure!" and include you. You're playing together. Happy and included. (Group of smiling faces) ← CORRECT

**Question:** "Which path helps you join the game?"

**Answer Options:**

- Button 1: Path 1 (Grab ball)
- Button 2: Path 2 (Stay silent)
- Button 3: Path 3 (Ask politely) ← CORRECT

**Feedback for Correct (Button 3):**

- Path 3 animates with green glow
- Text: "Perfect prediction! You thought: 'If I ask respectfully, they'll probably say yes.' Your thinking helped you choose an action that worked. Goal achieved!"
- Guide: "Polite asking opens doors that grabbing closes!"
- Points: +3

**Feedback for Incorrect:**

- Chosen path shows negative outcome clearly
- Text: "This path led to: \[describe outcome\]. Your goal was: join the game. Did this path get you there?"
- Correct path highlights: "Asking politely is the action that creates inclusion."
- Points: +1

**Scenario 3: Responding to Frustration (Moderate: Emotion + Action)**

**Web Display:**

- **Center Circle (Situation):**
  - Image: Your block tower just fell over accidentally (someone bumped table), blocks scattered
  - Text: "Your tower fell! You feel frustrated. What do you want? → To feel better AND fix the problem"

**Path 1:** "Yell at whoever bumped the table: 'You ruined it!'"

- **Effect:** They feel bad and defensive. Argument starts. You still feel frustrated AND now have conflict. Tower still broken. (Storm cloud icon)

**Path 2:** "Take a breath, then say: 'It was an accident. Can you help me rebuild?'"

- **Effect:** They apologize and help rebuild. Tower gets fixed faster. You feel better because problem is solved together. Friendship stays good. (Building blocks + heart icon) ← CORRECT

**Path 3:** "Give up and walk away from the blocks"

- **Effect:** Tower stays broken. You feel sad and frustrated still. Problem unsolved. (Broken blocks icon)

**Question:** "Which path helps you feel better AND fix the problem?"

**Answer Options:**

- Button 1: Path 1 (Yell)
- Button 2: Path 2 (Breathe, ask for help) ← CORRECT
- Button 3: Path 3 (Give up)

**Feedback for Correct (Button 2):**

- Path 2 glows green
- Text: "Excellent! You recognized that your Messenger (feeling frustrated) gave you information, but your Idea Factory could still think about the best action. You chose cooperation over anger. Both goals reached: problem solved + feeling better! That's using all three mind parts together!"
- Guide: "Feelings give info, but YOU choose the action. Smart choice!"
- Points: +3

**Feedback for Incorrect:**

- Selected path shows consequence
- Text: "This action led to: \[outcome\]. Check your goals: feel better + fix tower. Did this path achieve both?"
- Correct path highlights: "Asking for help turns frustration into cooperation. That's the action that works!"
- Points: +1

**Scenario 4: Being Included vs. Excluding (Complex: Empathy Required)**

**Web Display:**

- **Center Circle (Situation):**
  - Image: You and your friend playing a fun game, another child watching alone looking hopeful
  - Text: "You see someone alone wanting to play. What do you want? → To keep having fun AND be kind"

**Path 1:** "Ignore them and keep playing with just your friend"

- **Effect:** Child watching feels left out and sad. You have fun now, but later you might feel guilty. That child might not include you next time. (One sad face separated from two happy faces)

**Path 2:** "Say to your friend: 'Let's ask them to join us!'"

- **Effect:** All three of you play together. Everyone feels included and happy. More players = more fun! Kindness spreads. (Three happy faces in circle) ← CORRECT

**Path 3:** "Stop playing entirely because you don't know what to do"

- **Effect:** Everyone ends up not playing. No one has fun. Awkward feeling. (Three confused faces)

**Question:** "Which path helps you have fun AND be kind?"

**Answer Options:**

- Button 1: Path 1 (Ignore)
- Button 2: Path 2 (Invite to join) ← CORRECT
- Button 3: Path 3 (Stop playing)

**Feedback for Correct (Button 2):**

- Path 2 glows green
- Text: "Wonderful thinking! You predicted that including someone would make EVERYONE feel good, including you. This is empathy in action-thinking about others' feelings AND choosing an action that helps everyone. Both goals achieved!"
- Guide: "Including others doesn't take away your fun-it multiplies it!"
- Points: +3

**Feedback for Incorrect:**

- Selected path consequence displays
- Text: "Let's check: Your goals were fun + kindness. This path gave you: \[actual outcome\]. Did both goals get met?"
- Correct path highlights: "Inviting someone is the action that creates kindness and shared joy."
- Guide: "Remember: What do I want? → Which action helps? → I choose that one!"
- Points: +1

**Scenario 5: Classroom Responsibility (Complex: Delayed + Social Effect)**

**Web Display:**

- **Center Circle (Situation):**
  - Image: Classroom cleanup time, art supplies scattered, teacher asking everyone to help, you're tired
  - Text: "Cleanup time but you're tired. What do you want? → To get cleanup done quickly AND help your class"

**Path 1:** "Hide in the bathroom until cleanup is over"

- **Effect:** Cleanup takes much longer because you're not helping. Classmates frustrated. Teacher disappointed. Space stays messy longer. You feel guilty. (Clock + sad faces icon)

**Path 2:** "Help clean up even though you're tired-pick up the art supplies near you"

- **Effect:** Cleanup happens fast because everyone helps. Class ready for next activity quickly. Teacher and classmates appreciate your help. You feel proud and capable. (Checkmark + smiling faces icon) ← CORRECT

**Path 3:** "Complain loudly: 'This is too much work! I don't want to!'"

- **Effect:** Complaining makes others feel more tired too. Cleanup still has to happen but everyone's grumpy now. Takes longer. Bad mood spreads. (Grumpy faces + slow clock icon)

**Question:** "Which path helps cleanup finish quickly AND helps your class?"

**Answer Options:**

- Button 1: Path 1 (Hide)
- Button 2: Path 2 (Help even when tired) ← CORRECT
- Button 3: Path 3 (Complain)

**Feedback for Correct (Button 2):**

- Path 2 glows green
- Text: "Outstanding! You predicted that helping-even when tired-would make cleanup faster AND make you feel good about contributing. This is the thinking sequence working: your Messenger said 'I'm tired' (information), your Idea Factory thought 'If I help, we finish fast,' and your Action Player chose to help. Notice the loop: helping made you feel PROUD, which changed how your Messenger felt! That's loop power!"
- Guide: "Sometimes the helpful action takes effort, but it creates the best effects for everyone-including YOU!"
- Points: +3

**Feedback for Incorrect:**

- Selected path shows consequences
- Text: "This path led to: \[outcome\]. Your goals were: fast cleanup + help class. Did this action create those effects?"
- Correct path highlights: "Helping creates speed + good feelings. That's strategic action choice!"
- Guide: "Your Action Player can choose helpful actions even when your Messenger says 'I'm tired.' That's using your mind's power!"
- Points: +1

### Scoring

**Points System:**

- Correct choice on first try (predicted helpful action correctly): 3 points
- Correct choice after viewing feedback (learned from path analysis): 1 point
- Total possible: 15 points (5 scenarios × 3 points each)

**Visual Feedback:**

- Points display as "compass stars" collected in Guide's compass on left side of screen
- Each correct prediction adds animated star to compass
- Compass gradually fills with light as stars accumulate
- Progress indicator at top: "Paths Mapped: X/5"

**Bonus Recognition:**

- Students who score 13-15 points receive "Master Path Finder" badge (predicted correctly with minimal errors)
- Students who score 9-12 points receive "Strategic Thinker" badge (learned and applied)
- Students who score 5-8 points receive "Choice Explorer" badge (engaged with process)
- All students receive "Decision Mapper" badge for completion

**No Penalties:**

- Incorrect choices don't lose points
- Focus is on learning to predict and choose strategically, not on perfect performance

### Win Condition

**Completion Criteria:** Students complete the game by navigating all 5 choice web scenarios and making a selection for each (regardless of accuracy on first try).

**Success Screen (after Scenario 5):**

- **Background:** Decision lab with completed maps on walls, Guide standing proudly with full compass
- **Display:**
  - "Choice Mapping Complete!"
  - Compass with collected stars displayed, glowing
  - Badge earned shown with animation
  - Summary text: "You've mastered the thinking sequence! You learned that:"
    - ✓ "Every situation has multiple possible actions"
    - ✓ "Different actions lead to different effects"
    - ✓ "You can PREDICT effects before acting"
    - ✓ "Strategic thinking helps you choose helpful actions"
- **The Thinking Sequence Display:**
  - Large visual diagram appears showing:
    - "What do I WANT to happen?" (Goal identification)
    - "Which ACTION will help that happen?" (Prediction)
    - "I CHOOSE that one!" (Intentional selection)
  - Animation traces through all three steps with icons
- **Guide's Message:** "Brilliant work, Decision Mapper! You've discovered that thinking before acting gives you power to create helpful effects. Your Idea Factory can predict, and your Action Player can choose wisely. Remember: when you think first, you choose better!"
- **Key Insight:** "You have THREE mind parts working as a team: Messenger tells you what matters, Idea Factory predicts consequences, Action Player does what you choose. That's how you make smart decisions!"
- **Navigation Button:** "Return to the Park" (returns to lesson-09.03.html)

### Continuity Note

**Link to Prior Learning:** This game builds on Lessons 1-2's cause-effect understanding by adding the element of intentional choice. Students now see that:

- Lesson 1: Actions create effects (observation)
- Lesson 2: Small repeated actions accumulate (pattern)
- Lesson 3: We can CHOOSE actions strategically based on predicted effects (agency)

The Decision Web format makes the three-part mind model (Unit 1) operational: Thinking (predicting), Feeling (identifying what matters), and Doing (choosing actions) work together in the decision-making process.

**Link to Future Learning:** This game establishes strategic action selection that will be essential in:

- Lesson 4: When chosen actions don't create expected effects (mistakes), students can use the same thinking sequence to try differently
- Unit 10: Applying strategic action choice in group contexts (teamwork requires predicting how actions affect others)

The visual mapping of choices → consequences creates a mental model students will use throughout social situations, helping them pause and think rather than react automatically.

## In-Class-Game 9D – The Retry Lab

**Lesson 4: Learning from Mistakes**

### Lesson Link & Learning Objective

Students will reframe mistakes as learning feedback within the action-effect system, practice the mistake-learning sequence (Action → Unwanted Effect → Notice → Make Right → Try Differently), and demonstrate that mistakes provide information to adjust future choices.

### **Game File Name: icg-09.04-game01.html**

### **Game Title: **The Retry Lab****

### **Game Format**: **Comic Panel Editor** (Story, Choice & Narrative category)

****Format Justification**:** Comic Panel Editor is ideal for Lesson 4 because it makes the mistake-learning sequence tangible through visual story sequencing. Students actively reorder scrambled panels to construct the complete cycle: Action → Unwanted Effect → Notice What Happened → Make It Right → Try Differently Next Time. This format reinforces psychology-as-science by treating mistake recovery as an observable, systematic process with predictable stages-not a random or shameful event. Unlike static observation, the sequencing mechanic requires students to understand causal and temporal relationships: what must happen first, what comes next, and why. The comic strip format makes abstract concepts (reflection, repair, adjustment) concrete for 5-7 year olds through narrative structure. By physically ordering the steps, students internalize the learning cycle as a reliable pattern they can apply to their own mistakes.

### **Purpose**: Students practice recognizing and sequencing the complete mistake-learning cycle by arranging comic panels in correct order, building understanding that mistakes follow a predictable pattern from error to adjustment that supports growth rather than indicating failure

### **Lesson Arc Location:** Practice B (approximately minute 23 of 45). **Positioned:** AFTER students have seen the mistake-learning sequence modeled through role-play stations showing the full Action → Oops → Notice → Fix → Retry cycle. AFTER the in-class psychology experiment demonstrating the complete cycle with real examples. BEFORE the in-class quiz

****Pedagogical Reasoning**:** Similar to Lesson 3's placement strategy, this follows gradual release of responsibility ("I do, We do, You do"). Students have already:

- Observed complete mistake scenarios and recovery sequences in teacher-led experiments at stations (saw the pattern)
- Watched video showing famous mistakes leading to learning/innovation (saw pattern in broader context)
- Practiced meaningful apologies and adjustment through guided role-play (practiced with scaffolding)

The game provides experiential consolidation where students don't just observe or discuss the sequence-they actively CONSTRUCT it by determining correct order. This is crucial for internalization: arranging the steps requires understanding causality ("this must come before that because...") and temporal logic ("you can't make it right before noticing what happened").

The Comic Panel Editor format is strategically chosen because sequencing requires deeper processing than recognition. Students must:

- Identify what's happening in each panel
- Understand the relationship between panels
- Apply knowledge of the learning cycle to determine correct order
- Test their hypothesis by arranging panels

This mid-lesson placement (minute 23) means students engage with the format after seeing multiple complete cycles, so they have mental models to draw on. The game transforms abstract concepts ("mistakes are learning opportunities") into concrete procedural knowledge ("here's the exact sequence to follow"). This experiential understanding is essential for ages 5-7 who need concrete patterns to internalize abstract principles.

The sequencing task also removes shame from mistakes by treating them as puzzles to solve-neutral, interesting problems rather than failures. This reframing is the core pedagogical goal of Lesson 4.

### Setup

**Starting Screen:**

- **Background:** Bright workshop/lab setting with workbenches, tools, blueprint boards showing "mistake → learning" diagrams
- **Character Introduction:** Animated character "Fixer" (friendly cartoon inventor with tool belt, safety goggles, cheerful expression) appears
- **Welcome Message:**  
    "Welcome to the Retry Lab! I'm Fixer, and I'm an expert at learning from mistakes. Here's a secret: mistakes aren't failures-they're experiments that teach us what to try next! Every mistake follows a pattern. Want to learn the steps? Let's put them in order!"

**First Interaction:**

- Screen shows 5 comic-style panels scattered randomly on workspace
- Each panel is numbered (1-5) for clicker selection
- Text: "These panels tell a story about a mistake and how someone learned from it. But they're all mixed up! Your job: put them in the RIGHT ORDER to show the learning cycle."
- Visual cue: Empty "Story Strip" template at top with 5 blank spaces labeled "First → Second → Third → Fourth → Fifth"
- Instruction: "Look at all the panels. Figure out what happened FIRST, then SECOND, and so on. Press the number buttons (1-5) in the order they should go to build the learning story!"
- Fixer points: "Remember the pattern: Action → Unwanted Effect → Notice → Make Right → Try Differently!"

**Tutorial Prompt (First Time Only):**

- Small demo shows 3 simple panels (not from main game):
  - Panel A: Child drops cup
  - Panel B: Cup breaks, water spills
  - Panel C: Child cleans up mess
- Text: "What order tells the story? First → Second → Third?"
- Correct order: A → B → C (action → effect → response)
- Text: "Great! That's how cause-and-effect stories work. Now let's try longer learning stories!"

### Play

**Round Structure:** 4 mistake-learning stories, each with 5 panels to sequence

**Story 1: The Knocked-Over Blocks (Simple: Physical Mistake)**

**Five Scrambled Panels Display on Screen:**

**Panel 1:** Child running indoors, not looking where going, heading toward block tower **Panel 2:** Child's elbow hits tower, blocks crash everywhere, other child looks upset **Panel 3:** Child stops, looks at mess, thinks "Oh no! I knocked it over. I wasn't being careful." **Panel 4:** Child says to other: "I'm sorry I wasn't careful. Let me help you rebuild it." Both children rebuild together **Panel 5:** Child is now walking carefully indoors, sees another tower, walks around it slowly. Thought bubble: "I'll walk carefully inside so this doesn't happen again."

**Correct Sequence:** 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5

- First: Action (running carelessly)
- Second: Unwanted Effect (tower crashes, friend upset)
- Third: Notice What Happened (realizes mistake, understands cause)
- Fourth: Make It Right (apologizes specifically, helps repair)
- Fifth: Try Differently Next Time (changes future behavior)

**Student Task:**

- All 5 panels appear scattered on screen, each with large number (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
- Text: "Press the buttons in order: Which panel is FIRST? Then SECOND? Then THIRD? FOURTH? FIFTH?"
- Student presses clicker buttons in sequence: button 1, then button 2, then button 3, then button 4, then button 5
- As each button is pressed, that panel moves to next position in Story Strip at top
- After all 5 selections, game checks if order is correct

**Feedback for Correct Sequence (1→2→3→4→5):**

- Story Strip lights up green
- Animation plays showing story flow smoothly from first to last panel
- Checkmark appears above Story Strip
- Text: "Perfect! You've sequenced the complete learning cycle:
  - ACTION (running inside)
  - UNWANTED EFFECT (tower fell, friend hurt)
  - NOTICE (I wasn't careful)
  - MAKE RIGHT (apologize + help fix)
  - TRY DIFFERENTLY (walk carefully) This is how learning from mistakes works! Your Idea Factory noticed the problem, your Action Player made it right, and now you know what to do differently. That's growth!"
- Fixer: "That's the learning pattern! Mistakes → Adjustments → Better choices!"
- Points awarded: +5 (all panels correct on first try)

**Feedback for Incorrect Sequence:**

- Story Strip flashes yellow
- Text: "Hmm, let's check this order. Does the story make sense?"
- Game highlights where sequence breaks: "Look at these two panels. Does \[X\] happen before \[Y\]? Let's think about cause and effect..."
- Fixer: "Remember the pattern: First the action, then what happened (effect), then noticing, then fixing, then changing. Try again!"
- Panels return to scattered position
- Student gets another attempt
- Points awarded: +3 (correct on second try) or +1 (correct on third try)

**Teaching Moment After Completion:**

- Fixer appears: "Notice something important: This child didn't just say 'sorry' and walk away. They understood what they did (notice), made it right (helped rebuild), AND changed their future action (walk carefully). That's the FULL learning cycle!"

**Story 2: The Unkind Words (Moderate: Social/Emotional Mistake)**

**Five Scrambled Panels:**

**Panel 1:** Child says to classmate: "Your drawing looks weird!" (Speech bubble shows unkind comment) **Panel 2:** Classmate looks hurt, tears in eyes, stops drawing, covers picture **Panel 3:** First child notices classmate is upset, thinks: "Oh... my words hurt their feelings. I didn't think before I spoke." **Panel 4:** First child approaches: "I'm sorry I said your drawing looks weird. That was mean. Your drawing is actually creative-I like the colors you chose." Classmate looks up, starts to smile **Panel 5:** Later scene: First child sees another classmate's artwork, thinks before speaking: "I'll say something kind or nothing at all." Says: "I like how you used all those different shapes!"

**Correct Sequence:** 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5

- First: Action (unkind words)
- Second: Unwanted Effect (hurt feelings, damaged relationship)
- Third: Notice What Happened (recognizes impact of words)
- Fourth: Make It Right (meaningful apology with specific acknowledgment + kind words)
- Fifth: Try Differently Next Time (thinks before speaking, chooses kindness)

**Student Task:** Same format-press buttons to sequence panels

**Feedback for Correct:**

- Story Strip glows green
- Animation flows through sequence
- Text: "Excellent sequencing! You showed the complete learning cycle for social mistakes:
  - ACTION (unkind words)
  - UNWANTED EFFECT (hurt feelings)
  - NOTICE (my words caused pain)
  - MAKE RIGHT (real apology + kind words)
  - TRY DIFFERENTLY (think before speaking) Words create effects on others' feelings. This child learned to use their Idea Factory (think first) before their Action Player (speak)!"
- Fixer: "Learning from mistakes with people means noticing feelings, repairing relationships, and choosing kindness next time!"
- Points: +5 (first try), +3 (second try), or +1 (third try)

**Feedback for Incorrect:**

- Yellow flash, guidance provided
- Common error addressed: "Did the apology come before or after noticing the hurt? Can you make something right before you notice what happened?"
- Panels reset for retry

**Story 3: The Forgotten Promise (Complex: Responsibility Mistake)**

**Five Scrambled Panels:**

**Panel 1:** Child A tells Child B: "I'll bring back your book tomorrow, I promise!" Child B: "Okay, I trust you!" **Panel 2:** Next day-Child A forgot book at home. Child B looks disappointed and frustrated. "I needed that for my project..." **Panel 3:** Child A realizes: "I forgot! My friend was counting on me. I should have written it down or kept it in my backpack. I need to fix this." **Panel 4:** Child A says: "I'm really sorry I forgot your book. I know you needed it. I'll bring it first thing tomorrow, and I'll put a note in my backpack right now so I don't forget." Child B: "Okay, thank you for making a plan." **Panel 5:** Next day-Child A has book in hand early, gives it to Child B right away. Thought bubble: "Now I use reminders when I promise something. That way I keep my word!" Child B: "Thank you for remembering!"

**Correct Sequence:** 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5

- First: Action (making promise)
- Second: Unwanted Effect (breaking promise, letting someone down)
- Third: Notice What Happened (understands impact, identifies what went wrong-no reminder system)
- Fourth: Make It Right (specific apology + immediate plan to fix + prevent)
- Fifth: Try Differently Next Time (uses new system-reminder-to honor commitments)

**Student Task:** Sequence the 5 panels

**Feedback for Correct:**

- Story Strip glows green
- Text: "Outstanding work! This learning cycle shows responsibility growth:
  - ACTION (made promise)
  - UNWANTED EFFECT (broke promise, friend disappointed)
  - NOTICE (I forgot because I had no system)
  - MAKE RIGHT (apologize + deliver + create system)
  - TRY DIFFERENTLY (use reminders to keep promises) This child didn't just feel bad-they CHANGED their system. That's how mistakes teach us to build better habits! Your Idea Factory learned 'I need tools to help me remember,' and your Action Player created a new routine."
- Fixer: "The best learning includes changing what you DO, not just feeling sorry. This child built a new system!"
- Points: +5 (first try), +3 (second try), or +1 (third try)

**Feedback for Incorrect:**

- Yellow flash
- Guidance: "Think about TIME. What happens first-the promise or the forgetting? What must happen before you can notice what went wrong?"
- Panels reset

**Story 4: The Giving Up Too Soon (Complex: Persistence/Growth Mindset)**

**Five Scrambled Panels:**

**Panel 1:** Child trying to tie shoes, struggling, fingers tangled in laces **Panel 2:** Child throws laces down: "I can't do this! It's too hard!" Walks away frustrated, shoes untied **Panel 3:** Later, child thinks: "I gave up because it was hard. But if I don't practice, I'll never learn. Maybe I need to try again more slowly." **Panel 4:** Child asks adult: "Can you show me the steps again slowly? I want to keep trying." Adult helps, child practices step by step. "Loop, pull, now the bunny ears..." **Panel 5:** Days later-child practicing daily, getting better. Thought bubble: "It's still hard, but I'm getting it! Mistakes are part of learning. I just need to keep practicing." Successfully ties shoe!

**Correct Sequence:** 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5

- First: Action (attempting skill, struggling)
- Second: Unwanted Effect (frustration leads to giving up, problem unsolved)
- Third: Notice What Happened (recognizes giving up prevents learning, needs different approach)
- Fourth: Make It Right (asks for help, practices with patience)
- Fifth: Try Differently Next Time (adopts persistence, reframes struggle as normal part of learning)

**Student Task:** Sequence the 5 panels

**Feedback for Correct:**

- Story Strip glows green with extra sparkles
- Text: "Brilliant! This is the most powerful learning cycle-learning how to LEARN:
  - ACTION (trying new skill)
  - UNWANTED EFFECT (frustration → giving up)
  - NOTICE (giving up stops learning, I need patience)
  - MAKE RIGHT (ask for help, practice slowly)
  - TRY DIFFERENTLY (keep trying, see mistakes as learning) This child learned that struggle is part of growth! Your Messenger (feelings) said 'frustrated,' but your Idea Factory learned 'frustration means I'm learning something new,' and your Action Player chose to keep practicing. That's what psychologists call a GROWTH MINDSET-understanding that your brain grows through effort and mistakes!"
- Fixer: "This is the ultimate lesson: mistakes and struggles aren't signs you CAN'T-they're signs you're LEARNING! The learning cycle works for learning itself!"
- Points: +5 (first try), +3 (second try), or +1 (third try)

**Feedback for Incorrect:**

- Yellow flash
- Guidance: "This story is tricky! What happened FIRST-struggling or giving up? What came AFTER giving up-staying away forever, or changing their mind? Think about the child's thinking changing over time."
- Panels reset

- **Fixer's Message:** "Incredible work, Learning Lab Graduate! You've discovered that mistakes aren't enemies-they're teachers! Every mistake gives your brain information: 'That didn't work. Let me try something different.' That's how you grow! Remember: Your three mind parts work as a team in this cycle. Your Messenger tells you something feels wrong (information!), your Idea Factory figures out what to change (thinking!), and your Action Player tries the new way (doing!). Together, they turn 'oops' into 'awesome!'"
- **Key Insight - Growth Mindset:**

- **Navigation Button:** "Return to the Park" (returns to lesson-09.04.html)

### Continuity Note

**Link to Prior Learning:** This game completes Unit 9's progression:

- Lesson 1: Actions create effects (understanding cause-effect)
- Lesson 2: Small repeated actions accumulate (understanding patterns over time)
- Lesson 3: We can choose actions strategically (understanding intentional selection)
- Lesson 4: When effects don't match expectations, we adjust and try again (understanding learning as system)

The Comic Panel Editor format reinforces that mistake-recovery follows the same systematic cause-effect logic as all other actions-it's an observable, predictable process, not chaos. By sequencing the steps, students see mistakes as part of the larger action-effect system introduced in Lesson 1.

**Link to Future Learning:** This game prepares students for Unit 10 (Teamwork and Cooperation) by:

- Normalizing that mistakes happen in all contexts, including group work
- Establishing that the learning cycle applies socially (fixing relationships, adjusting team behavior)
- Building resilience through understanding mistakes as information rather than identity

The mistake-learning sequence becomes a portable tool students can apply to any challenging situation: personal, social, academic, or collaborative. The cycle metaphor (not a dead-end) emphasizes that learning never stops-there will always be new challenges, and the same pattern helps navigate them all.
