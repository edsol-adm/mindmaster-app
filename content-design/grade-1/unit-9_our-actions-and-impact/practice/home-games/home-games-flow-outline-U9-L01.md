## Home Game 1A – Ripple Detective: Find the Effect
> Jump to: [Setup](#setup) · [Play](#play) · [Scoring](#scoring) · [Win Condition](#win-condition) · [Continuity Note](#continuity-note)

### Learning Objective
Students identify everyday cause-and-effect relationships, recognizing that actions create effects—sometimes immediately, sometimes over time—and these effects shape what happens to themselves, others, and their environment.

### Game File Name & Format
`hg-09.01-01.html` — Cause & Effect Chains (Science App format)

### Game Purpose
This game reinforces cause-and-effect recognition by having players actively construct action-effect pairs and sequences. Players learn to predict what happens after an action and distinguish between immediate and delayed effects through interactive experimentation.

### Estimated Play Time
7–9 minutes (6 rounds × 60 seconds each + final challenge and victory screen)

---

### Setup
**Opening Screen:**
- Title: "Ripple Detective: Find the Effect"

- Instruction text: "Every action creates an effect, like a ripple in water. Can you find what happens after each action?"
- Button: "Start Detective Work" (green, centred)

**First Scene:**
- Background: Simple park scene with cartoon elements (tree, bench, sandbox)
- Top banner: "Scene 1: What Happens Next?"

### Continuity Note
This game introduces Sam the Scientist as a recurring guide for Unit 9 home games. The ripple metaphor established here reappears in Game 2A (Lesson 2) when exploring how small repeated actions accumulate. The cause-effect reasoning developed here builds the foundation for predicting consequences in Lesson 3 games.

## Home Game 1B – Effect Explorer: Build the Story
> Jump to: [Setup](#setup-1) · [Play](#play-1) · [Scoring](#scoring-1) · [Win Condition](#win-condition-1) · [Continuity Note](#continuity-note-1)

### Learning Objective
Students identify everyday cause-and-effect relationships and explain how their actions influence themselves, others, and their environment through immediate and delayed effects.

### Game File Name
`hg-09.01-02.html`

### Game Title
Effect Explorer: Build the Story

### Game Format
Interactive Fiction / Branching Story (Adventure Game format)

A choice-driven narrative game where each decision creates visible effects, teaching players that their actions shape story outcomes. Players see immediate visual feedback and track cumulative effects across a branching storyline.

### Purpose
This game deepens cause-effect understanding by placing players in control of a character's choices. Unlike passive observation, players actively cause effects through decision-making and see multiple outcomes based on their action selections, reinforcing the lesson that "actions shape what happens next."

### Setup
**Opening Screen:**
- Title: "Effect Explorer: Build the Story"  
- Visual: Cartoon character "Maya" (recurring avatar) standing at a crossroads with three paths  
- Instruction: "Maya needs your help! Every choice you make will create effects. Watch what happens!"  
- Character info box: "This is Maya. She's exploring how actions work. Help her make choices and see the effects!"  
- Button: "Start Maya's Day" (blue, centered)  

**Story Introduction:**

- Visual: Maya sits on bed, looking at player, waiting for choice

- Maya watches from the side  
  - Choice A: "Try to join anyway" → Leo remembers earlier, is hesitant but eventually says okay  
  - Choice B: "Play alone" → Maya plays by herself  

Narration: "Look at all the effects from today's choices!"

---

**FINAL REVIEW SCREEN: The Effect Map**

After Decision 5, game shows a visual map of all choices and their effects:  
- Timeline display: Morning → Breakfast → School → Classwork → Playground  
- Each decision point marked with icon  
- Lines connecting choices to effects (like a flowchart)  
- Highlighted effects accumulated throughout the day  

Sam the Scientist appears: "Wow! Look at how Maya's actions created all these effects. Some effects happened right away. Others took time to appear. But every choice mattered!"  

**Interactive Element:** Player can tap any decision point to replay just that moment and see what the alternative effect would have been (comparison mode)

---

### Scoring
**Effect Token System:**
- Helpful Effect Token (green star): +10 tokens for choices that helped self or others  
- Problem Effect Token (yellow warning): +5 tokens for choices that created problems (still counts as learning about effects!)  
- Friendship Effect Token (blue heart): +15 bonus tokens if choices built relationships  
- Learning Effect Token (purple book): +5 tokens for each delayed effect correctly observed  

**Bonus:**
- Completed full story: +20 tokens  
- Reviewed Effect Map: +10 tokens  
- Compared alternative outcomes: +5 tokens per comparison  

**Visual Display:**
- Token counter in top-right corner  
- Each token type shown with icon  
- Total displayed at end  

No "best path" emphasized – game celebrates that all choices create observable effects (aligns with science framework, not moral judgment)

---

### Win Condition
Player completes Maya's day by making all 5 decisions. There is no "losing"—every path leads to completion because every action creates an effect (the core lesson).

**Completion Screen:**
- Maya appears with Sam the Scientist  
- Message: "You explored how actions create effects! Maya's day was shaped by the choices you made. In real life, your actions work the same way."  
- Display: Effect Map summary, token collection  
- Buttons: "Try Different Choices" (replay) | "Return to Home Games"  

---

### Continuity Note
Maya becomes a recurring character for Unit 9 home games. The branching story format used here mirrors real-life decision-making. This game pairs with Game 1A (cause-effect recognition) by adding player agency—instead of identifying effects, players actively create them. The Effect Map visualization will be referenced in Lesson 2's games when exploring cumulative small choices.

## How Lesson 1 Fits into the Full Learning Arc

Lesson 1 begins Unit 9 by introducing the foundational psychology concept of **cause and effect**—the idea that every action sets something in motion. Through both home games, students move from *observing* cause-effect relationships (Ripple Detective) to *experiencing* them through interactive decisions (Effect Explorer). This marks the first step in developing responsibility and self-efficacy: if actions create effects, then one’s choices have genuine power.

- **Lesson 1 (this document):** Builds awareness that all actions, big or small, create effects—some immediate, others delayed. Students begin to see the “ripple” their behaviour sends into the world.  
- **Lesson 2:** Expands this understanding by showing that small, repeated actions accumulate into larger outcomes over time.  
- **Lesson 3:** Advances from awareness to intentionality, teaching students to predict consequences and choose helpful actions purposefully.  
- **Lesson 4:** Completes the cycle by reframing mistakes as learning feedback within the cause-effect system—actions produce results, and those results teach us how to act better next time.

> 🌊 **Learning Arc Summary:** From noticing cause and effect → to guiding choices intentionally → to learning from results.  
> By the end of Unit 9, students internalise that actions are not random—they shape experiences for themselves, others, and the environment. This growing awareness transforms responsibility from rule-following into conscious, empowered decision-making, laying the groundwork for Unit 10’s focus on teamwork and collective impact.
