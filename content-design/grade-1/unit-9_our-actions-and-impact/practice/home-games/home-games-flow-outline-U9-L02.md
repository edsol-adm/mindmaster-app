> Jump to: [Setup](#setup) · [Play](#play) · [Scoring](#scoring) · [Win Condition](#win-condition) · [Continuity Note](#continuity-note)

### Learning Objective

Students understand that repeated small actions accumulate to create larger patterns and outcomes, and recognize that even small everyday choices carry real weight in shaping what happens for themselves, others, and the environment.

### Game File Name & Format

`hg-09.02-01.html` — Simulation / Sandbox with Time Progression (Science App format)

A visual simulation game where players perform small repeated actions (water plant, say something kind, tidy one thing) over many “days” (fast-forwarded) to see cumulative effects. Players experiment with different patterns (frequency, consistency) and observe long-term patterns emerge.

### Game Purpose

This game demonstrates accumulation mechanics by letting players see small actions compound into significant effects. Unlike one-time cause-effect games, this emphasizes repetition over time—the core insight of Lesson 2. Players experiment with different patterns to discover how consistency shapes outcomes.

### Estimated Play Time

9–12 minutes
Each scenario: 3–4 minutes (30 days × 3–5 seconds per day)
Final Comparison Lab: 2 minutes
Total if playing all three scenarios: ~12 min

### Setup

Opening Screen:

* Title: "Ripple Builder: Watch It Grow"
* Visual: Sam the Scientist (recurring avatar) standing beside three empty "growth zones" (plant pot, friendship meter, clean room display)
* Instruction: "Small actions add up! Pick a goal, do small actions every day, and watch what grows!"
* Three goal buttons:

  * "Grow a Garden" (green)
  * "Build a Friendship" (blue)
  * "Keep Room Tidy" (purple)
* Text: "Choose your first goal!"

Player selects one goal to start (can replay to try others)

---

### Play

Core Mechanic: Daily Action Selection + Time-Lapse Visualization

SCENARIO 1: Grow a Garden

Setup:

* Scene: Garden plot with small seed planted in soil
* Calendar appears: Day 1
* Instruction: "This seed needs care. Will you water it today?"
* Two buttons: "Water the plant" | "Skip today"

Daily Cycle (30 days compressed):
Each "day" lasts 3–5 seconds of real time. Player chooses action for that day.

If player chooses "Water the plant" consistently:

* Day 1: Seed in soil (no visible change yet)
* Day 3: Tiny sprout appears
* Day 7: Small stem with leaves
* Day 14: Plant grows taller, more leaves
* Day 21: Buds appear
* Day 30: Full bloom—beautiful flower!

Visual feedback each day:

* Water animation plays (watering can pouring)
* Plant growth slightly visible
* Progress bar: "Growth: X%"

If player skips days:

* Plant stops growing
* After 3 consecutive skipped days: plant droops slightly
* If player resumes watering: plant recovers and continues growing (demonstrates that restarting helps!)

Day Counter visible: "Day X of 30"

At Day 30 (End of Garden Scenario):

* Final result shows based on consistency:

  * Watered 25–30 days: Full blooming garden, vibrant colors
  * Watered 15–24 days: Healthy plant, some flowers
  * Watered 10–14 days: Small plant, struggling
  * Watered <10 days: Wilted plant
* Sam appears: "Look at what happened! Every time you watered the plant—just a small action—it added up. Day by day, the effects grew. That's how small actions work!"

Comparison Screen:

* Shows side-by-side visual: "If you water every day vs. if you skip many days"
* Dramatic difference illustrated

---

SCENARIO 2: Build a Friendship

Setup:

* Scene: Schoolyard with two characters: Maya (recurring character) and new classmate "Zoe"
* Calendar: Day 1
* Instruction: "Maya wants to become friends with Zoe. Will she do something kind today?"
* Two buttons: "Say something kind" | "Ignore Zoe"

Daily Cycle (30 days compressed):

If player chooses "Say something kind" consistently:

* Day 1: Maya says "Hi!" → Zoe looks surprised
* Day 3: Maya shares a toy → Zoe smiles
* Day 7: Maya invites Zoe to play → Zoe joins
* Day 14: Zoe and Maya play together every day
* Day 21: Zoe brings toy to share with Maya (reciprocity!)
* Day 30: Maya and Zoe are best friends, playing and laughing together

Visual feedback:

* Speech bubbles show kind words
* Friendship meter fills up (heart icon grows)
* Characters move closer together over time

If player chooses "Ignore Zoe" many days:

* Zoe stays distant
* Friendship meter stays low
* By Day 30: Zoe plays with other kids, Maya is alone

If player is inconsistent (kind some days, ignores other days):

* Friendship grows slowly
* Zoe is sometimes interested, sometimes not
* Demonstrates that consistency matters

At Day 30:

* Final friendship level displayed:

  * 25–30 kind actions: "Best Friends!" – both characters hugging
  * 15–24 kind actions: "Good Friends" – playing together sometimes
  * 10–14 kind actions: "Starting to know each other"
  * <10 kind actions: "Still strangers"
* Sam appears: "See that? One kind word didn't make them best friends. But saying kind words every day—over and over—built a strong friendship. Small actions repeated = big effects!"

SCENARIO 3: Keep Room Tidy

Setup:

* Scene: Child's bedroom, slightly messy
* Calendar: Day 1
* Instruction: "A tidy room feels good! Will you put away one toy today?"
* Two buttons: "Tidy up one thing" | "Leave it messy"

Daily Cycle (30 days compressed):

If player chooses "Tidy up one thing" consistently:

* Day 1: One toy put away, room 95% messy
* Day 5: Several toys organized, room 80% messy
* Day 10: Half the room tidy
* Day 20: Room mostly organized
* Day 30: Room completely clean and organized!

Visual feedback:

* Animation of toy being placed in box
* Room slowly transforms from messy to tidy
* Progress bar: "Room Tidiness: X%"

If player chooses "Leave it messy:"

* New messes appear each day (toys, clothes scattered)
* By Day 10: room is very messy
* By Day 30: room is chaotic, hard to find anything

If inconsistent:

* Room gets somewhat better but never fully clean
* Shows that stopping and starting makes progress slower

At Day 30:

* Final room state displayed:

  * 25–30 tidy actions: Perfectly organized, everything has a place
  * 15–24 tidy actions: Mostly tidy, some clutter
  * 10–14 tidy actions: Still pretty messy
  * <10 tidy actions: Very messy, chaotic
* Sam appears: "One small tidy-up didn't make a big difference. But doing it every day? Look at the room now! Small actions add up over time."

---

FINAL COMPARISON SCREEN (After Completing One Scenario):

* "Want to try a different goal?"
* Shows all three scenarios side-by-side with results
* Player can select another goal to replay
* After completing all three, unlock final screen

Final Screen: The Accumulation Lab

* Sam the Scientist appears in a "lab" setting with charts showing all three scenarios:
  "You discovered the Accumulation Effect! Small actions don't seem like much on Day 1. But by Day 30, they create BIG changes. That's the power of repeating small choices."
* Interactive Element: "Now experiment! What if you watered the plant only 5 days? What if you were kind 20 days instead of 30?"

  * Player can adjust slider: "Number of days action repeated: 1–30"
  * Graph shows projected outcome
  * Try different numbers to see how results change

### Continuity Note

This game directly extends the ripple metaphor from Game 1A by showing ripples compound over time. Sam the Scientist continues as guide. The time-lapse visualization technique used here will inform Lesson 3 games where players predict long-term consequences. The three scenarios (plant, friendship, room) demonstrate that accumulation principles apply across different domains—preparing for Lesson 3's focus on intentional action selection.

## Home Game 2B – Chain Reaction Challenge

> Jump to: [Setup](#setup-1) · [Play](#play-1) · [Scoring](#scoring-1) · [Win Condition](#win-condition-1) · [Continuity Note](#continuity-note-1)

### Learning Objective

Students provide examples of how small daily choices build into bigger effects, compare cumulative effects of helpful versus unhelpful actions, and apply understanding that their everyday choices carry real weight.

### Game File Name & Format

`hg-09.02-02.html` — Physics Puzzle / Rube Goldberg Machine Builder (Puzzle Game format)

A creative construction game where players build chain reactions by placing small action tiles that trigger sequential effects. Each small action connects to the next, demonstrating how tiny choices link together to create large outcomes.

### Game Purpose

This game makes accumulation tangible through spatial, visual problem-solving. Players see small actions literally chain together, reinforcing that one small choice leads to another, which leads to another—creating powerful cumulative effects. The physics-puzzle format engages spatial reasoning while teaching the lesson concept.

### Continuity Note

This game extends the accumulation concept from Game 2A by showing how small actions connect and trigger each other in sequence. The chain reaction metaphor is new but complements the ripple metaphor from Game 1A and 2A. Maya continues as a character guide. The puzzle-solving approach prepares students for Lesson 3's emphasis on intentional action selection—here they practice seeing how action sequences work, which helps them later predict consequences strategically.

## How Lesson 2 Fits into the Full Learning Arc

Lesson 2 deepens Unit 9 by introducing the principle of **accumulation**—small, repeated actions that compound into larger outcomes over time. Through both home games, students move from *noticing* single effects to *tracking* how consistency and sequence amplify results. This builds self‑efficacy: if repeated small choices change what happens, then I can shape my day, my relationships, and my environment.

* **Lesson 2 (this document):** Demonstrates that repetition and sequence matter. Learners test how daily actions add up across contexts (garden, friendship, tidy room) and build functioning chains—turning “little choices” into visible change.
* **Lesson 1:** Established basic cause‑and‑effect awareness—the first ripple of agency that sets something in motion and prepares students to examine patterns over time.
* **Lesson 3:** Advances from understanding to *intentionality*: students predict consequences and choose helpful actions on purpose, selecting sequences that lead toward desired effects.
* **Lesson 4:** Completes the cycle by treating results as feedback; patterns can be redirected and new helpful routines can replace unhelpful ones.

> 🌱 **Learning Arc Summary:** Noticing cause and effect → understanding accumulation → choosing actions intentionally → learning from feedback.
> By the end of Unit 9, students internalise that everyday decisions—especially small ones repeated—carry real weight. This shifts responsibility from rule‑following to informed, confident agency, laying the groundwork for Unit 10’s teamwork focus where reliable contributions compound into collective impact.
