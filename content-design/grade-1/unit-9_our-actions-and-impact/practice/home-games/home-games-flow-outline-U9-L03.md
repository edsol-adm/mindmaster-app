### Learning Objective

Students distinguish between helpful and unhelpful actions by analyzing their effects, learn to predict consequences before acting, and apply intentional action selection to choose behaviors that lead to positive results.

### Game File Name & Format

`hg-09.03-01.html` — Scenario Choices with Prediction Mechanic (Mental Health App format, enhanced with prediction layer)

### Game Purpose

A decision-making game where players must first predict the effect of each possible action, then choose an action, and finally observe whether their prediction was correct. This three-step process (Predict → Choose → Observe) reinforces consequence-thinking before action.

This game teaches strategic action selection by requiring players to think through consequences before choosing actions. Unlike reactive games, players must slow down and use their "thinking brain" to predict effects—developing the mental habit of considering outcomes before acting, which is the core of intentional behavior.

### Estimated Play Time

### Play

Game Structure: 8 Scenarios with Prediction Mechanic

Each scenario follows the same structure but increases in complexity.

#### Scenario 1: Playground – Someone Left Out

Scene: Playground. Maya sees Leo sitting alone while others play soccer.

Situation Text: "Leo is sitting alone. Maya wants to play soccer with the group. What should she do?"

**STEP 1 – PREDICT:** Player sees 3 action options:

* Action A: Invite Leo to join the soccer game
* Action B: Play soccer without inviting Leo
* Action C: Ignore everyone and play alone

For **each** action, player must predict the effect:

**Action A Prediction:** "If Maya invites Leo, what will happen?"

* Choice 1: Leo will feel happy and join (helpful effect)
* Choice 2: Leo will refuse (neutral effect)
* Choice 3: Others will get mad (unhelpful effect)

**Action B Prediction:** "If Maya plays without inviting Leo, what will happen?"

* Choice 1: Leo will feel left out (unhelpful effect)
* Choice 2: Leo won't notice (neutral)
* Choice 3: Leo will join anyway (unlikely)

**Action C Prediction:** "If Maya plays alone, what will happen?"

* Choice 1: Everyone plays separately (neutral)
* Choice 2: Maya misses out on fun (unhelpful to self)
* Choice 3: Others invite Maya anyway (neutral)

**STEP 2 – CHOOSE:** After making predictions, prompt appears: "Which action will create the most helpful effect? Choose now!"

Player selects Action A, B, or C.

**STEP 3 – OBSERVE:** Animation plays showing the actual effect:

If **Action A** chosen:

* Maya walks to Leo: "Want to play soccer with us?"
* Leo's face lights up: "Yes! Thanks for asking!"
* They both join the game, everyone is happy
* Effect Confirmed: Helpful effect – Leo feels included, friendship strengthens

Prediction Feedback:

* If player predicted correctly: "Great prediction! You knew inviting Leo would create a helpful effect."
* If player predicted incorrectly: "Interesting! The effect was different than you predicted. Leo felt happy when included."

Scoring for Scenario:

* Correct prediction: +10 points
* Chose helpful action: +15 points
* Bonus if both: +5 extra points

#### Scenario 2: Classroom – Forgot Materials

Scene: Classroom. Maya forgot her pencil. Zoe has extras.

Situation: "Maya needs a pencil for the test. What should she do?"

3 Action Options:

* Action A: Ask Zoe politely if she can borrow one
* Action B: Take Zoe's extra pencil without asking
* Action C: Don't take the test

**PREDICT Phase:** For each action, player predicts:

* What will Zoe do?
* What will the teacher do?
* How will Maya feel?

**CHOOSE Phase:** Player selects one action.

**OBSERVE Phase:** Animation shows actual consequences:

If **Action A** (ask politely):

* Zoe smiles: "Sure, here you go!"
* Maya takes test successfully
* Teacher notices: "Good problem-solving, Maya."
* Effect: Helpful – need met, relationship preserved, teacher approval

If **Action B** (take without asking):

* Zoe notices: "Hey! That's mine!"
* Teacher sees conflict: "Maya, did you ask first?"
* Maya feels embarrassed
* Effect: Unhelpful – conflict created, trust damaged

If **Action C** (skip test):

* Maya sits quietly, doesn't take test
* Teacher asks: "Maya, where's your pencil?"
* Maya misses test opportunity
* Effect: Unhelpful to self – problem not solved

Prediction Feedback + Scoring

#### Scenario 3: Lunchtime – Friend Drops Food

### Continuity Note

This game applies the prediction skill developed in Games 1A, 1B, and 2A/2B—now players must actively forecast effects rather than just observe them. The Predict → Choose → Observe sequence mirrors real-life decision-making. Maya continues as the character needing help, maintaining continuity. This game prepares for Lesson 4 where players learn that sometimes predictions are wrong (mistakes happen) and that's part of learning.

> Jump to: [Setup](#setup-1) · [Play](#play-1) · [Scoring](#scoring-1) · [Win Condition](#win-condition-1) · [Continuity Note](#continuity-note-1)

### Learning Objective

Students recognize patterns showing how certain actions consistently produce helpful outcomes while others create problems, and demonstrate intentional action selection by explaining why they chose particular behaviors.

### Game File Name & Format

`hg-09.03-02.html` — Classification Trees with Data Analysis (Science App format)

### Game Purpose

A pattern-recognition game where players observe multiple examples of actions and their effects, then classify actions into "Consistently Helpful," "Sometimes Helpful," or "Usually Unhelpful" categories based on observed patterns. Players become scientists analyzing behavioral data.

This game teaches players to recognize cause-effect patterns across multiple instances—moving beyond individual scenarios to see which types of actions reliably produce which types of effects. This meta-cognitive skill helps students develop action-selection strategies based on evidence rather than impulse.

### Estimated Play Time

10–12 minutes

* 6 action types × 1.5 minutes each = 9 min
* Prediction Challenge: 2 min

### Continuity Note

This game synthesizes learning from Game 3A (predicting individual scenarios) by showing patterns across multiple scenarios. The scientific approach (observe, collect data, identify patterns) reinforces psychology-as-science framework. Sam continues as scientist guide. The Pattern Map becomes a reference tool students can use mentally in real life ("Which action is on my Consistently Helpful list?"). This prepares for Lesson 4 where students learn that even with good patterns, sometimes actions don't work as expected (mistakes/variability).

## How Lesson 3 Fits into the Full Learning Arc

Lesson 3 moves Unit 9 from simply *seeing* that actions have effects (Lesson 1) and that small choices accumulate over time (Lesson 2) to **intentionally steering actions based on predicted consequences and patterns**. Through both home games, students practise using their thinking brain ahead of time: first to forecast likely outcomes (Game 3A) and then to read evidence from repeated examples (Game 3B) so they can choose actions that reliably support themselves, others, and their environment.

* **Lesson 3 (this document):** Strengthens intentionality and responsibility. Students predict consequences (Predict → Choose → Observe), compare helpful vs unhelpful options, and discover stable patterns of "consistently helpful" actions. They begin to see that wise choices are not about being "good" but about using evidence to pick actions that lead to desired effects.
* **Lesson 1:** Introduced the basic cause-and-effect system—every action sends out ripples. Students started noticing how choices create outcomes for themselves, others, and shared spaces.
* **Lesson 2:** Showed how *repeated* small actions build into larger patterns over time, turning everyday behaviours into long-term results in relationships, spaces, and habits.
* **Lesson 4:** Will complete the cycle by treating mismatches between action and outcome as data, not failure. Students will learn to notice unintended effects, repair harm, and adjust future choices—using mistakes as feedback to refine their action patterns.

> 🌊 **Learning Arc Summary:** Noticing single action–effect links → seeing how small choices accumulate → using prediction and patterns to choose helpful actions → learning from mistakes when outcomes don’t match intentions.
> By the end of Unit 9, students experience themselves as active shapers of their world: they can read cause-and-effect, recognise reliable helpful actions, and adjust when things go wrong. This grounded sense of agency prepares them for Unit 10, where individual responsibility becomes the foundation for effective teamwork and shared impact.
