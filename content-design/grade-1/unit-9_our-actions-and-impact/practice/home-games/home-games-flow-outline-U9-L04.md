> Jump to: [Setup](#setup) · [Play](#play) · [Scoring](#scoring) · [Win Condition](#win-condition) · [Continuity Note](#continuity-note)

### Learning Objective
Students define mistakes as situations where actions produced unintended or unwanted effects, distinguish between accidents and poor choices as learning opportunities, and apply the mistake-learning sequence: Action → Unwanted Effect → Notice → Make Right → Try Differently.

### Game File Name
hg-09.04-01.html

### Game Format
Virtual Experiments with Adjustment Cycles (Science App format)

An experimental game where players intentionally try actions, observe when they don't produce desired effects, and practice the recovery sequence. Players see mistakes as data points in an experiment rather than failures.

### Purpose
This game reframes mistakes as natural parts of learning by having players actively experiment with actions, notice mismatches between intended and actual effects, and practice adjustment. The "lab" framing emphasizes scientific learning: hypothesis → test → observe → adjust—normalizing mistakes as essential learning feedback.

  - TRY an action
  - NOTICE the effect
  - MAKE IT RIGHT (if needed)
  - TRY DIFFERENTLY next time
- Maya: "Let's start experimenting!"

### ****FINAL LAB REPORT:****

After all 6 experiments, Sam presents comprehensive lab report:

**"Experiment Summary: What We Learned About Mistakes"**

**Data Collected:**

- Total experiments: 6
- Actions that didn't work as intended: 6
- Recoveries completed: 6
- New strategies learned: 6

**Key Findings:**

- Mistakes happen when effects don't match intentions
- Mistakes give us information about what to do differently
- Making it right involves: apologizing, fixing problems, learning
- Trying differently prevents the same mistake again

**Pattern Recognition:**

- Some mistakes were ACCIDENTS (didn't mean to, but careless)
- Some mistakes were POOR CHOICES (should have thought more)
- BOTH types are learning opportunities!

**Most Important Discovery:**

- Mistakes + Recovery + Learning = Getting Better!
- The formula: ❌ → ✓ → 📈 (Mistake → Fix → Growth)

**Interactive Element:** "Now YOU are the scientist! Tell us about a mistake YOU made:"

- Input fields appear: What happened? How did you fix it? What did you learn?
- Player can record personal mistake-learning story
- Added to personal lab journal

## HOME GAME 4B - The Apology Architect
> Jump to: [Setup](#setup) · [Play](#play) · [Scoring](#scoring) · [Win Condition](#win-condition) · [Continuity Note](#continuity-note)

### Learning Objective

Students explain how mistakes help minds learn and adjust, demonstrate making things right by practicing meaningful apologies connected to specific actions and effects, and recognize that mistakes provide learning opportunities rather than indicating inadequacy.

### Game File Name

hg-09.04-02.html

### Game Format

**Interactive Fiction with Branching Dialogue** (Adventure Game format, dialogue-focused)

A narrative game where players construct meaningful apologies by selecting specific components (what happened, how it affected others, what to do differently) and see how different apology types create different effects. Players learn that apologies are action-based communication tools, not empty phrases.

### Purpose

This game teaches the mechanics of genuine apologies as part of the mistake-recovery process. By building apologies component-by-component and seeing outcomes, players learn that effective apologies acknowledge specific actions, recognize effects, and demonstrate future change-skills that repair relationships and complete the learning cycle.

### Estimated Play Time

**10-12 minutes**

- 6 scenarios × 1.5-2 minutes each = 9-12 min
- Apology Comparison Lab: 2 min
- Personal scenario creation: 1-2 min (optional)

---

### Setup

**Opening Screen:**

- Title: "The Apology Architect"
- Visual: Sam the Scientist with Maya and Leo, standing before a "construction site" where apologies are being built like structures
- Instruction: "Apologies are like bridges. Build them well and they connect people. Build them poorly and the gap stays!"
- Sam: "Let's learn how to build strong apologies that repair and teach!"
- Button: "Start Building" (gold, centered)

**Tutorial Scene:**

**Example Mistake:** Maya accidentally knocked over Leo's art project.

**Three Apology Options Shown:**

**Apology A (Empty):**

- "Sorry." (walks away)
- Effect: Leo still upset, doesn't feel heard
- Bridge visual: Broken, incomplete

**Apology B (Blame-Shifting):**

- "Sorry, but you shouldn't have put it there."
- Effect: Leo more upset, feels blamed
- Bridge visual: Collapses

**Apology C (Meaningful):**

- "I knocked over your art project, which made you upset and ruined your work. I should have been more careful. Next time I'll watch where I'm walking. Can I help you fix it?"
- Effect: Leo feels understood, accepts apology, both fix project together
- Bridge visual: Strong, complete, connects both sides

**Sam explains:** "See the difference? Apology C has all the important parts:

- **What happened** (I knocked over your project)
- **The effect** (you're upset, work ruined)
- **What to do differently** (watch where I walk)
- **Make it right** (help fix it)

That's a strong apology! Now you build some!"

### Play

**Game Structure: 6 Mistake Scenarios, Build Custom Apologies**

Each scenario presents a mistake. Player constructs an apology by selecting components. The game shows how well the apology works based on what was included.

### ****SCENARIO 1: The Interrupted Story****

**Mistake:** Maya interrupted Leo while he was telling an exciting story to friends.

**Effect:** Leo stopped talking, looked hurt, friends felt uncomfortable.

**Build Your Apology:**

Player sees an apology "blueprint" with slots to fill:

**SLOT 1 - Acknowledge What Happened:** Choose one:

- A) "I interrupted you..." ✓ (specific)
- B) "Something happened..." ✗ (vague)
- C) "You stopped talking..." ✗ (focuses on Leo, not Maya's action)

**SLOT 2 - Recognize the Effect:** Choose one:

- A) "...which made you stop your story and feel hurt." ✓ (names effect)
- B) "...and it was bad." ✗ (vague)
- C) "...but it wasn't a big deal." ✗ (minimizes effect)

**SLOT 3 - Explain What You'll Do Differently:** Choose one:

- A) "Next time, I'll wait until you finish before I talk." ✓ (specific plan)
- B) "Next time, I'll try to be better." ✗ (vague)
- C) (Skip this part) ✗ (incomplete apology)

**SLOT 4 - Offer to Make It Right:** Choose one:

- A) "Would you like to finish your story now? I'll listen!" ✓ (repair action)
- B) "Let's just forget about it." ✗ (avoids repair)
- C) (Skip this part) ✗ (incomplete)

**Apology Built:** "I interrupted you, which made you stop your story and feel hurt. Next time, I'll wait until you finish before I talk. Would you like to finish your story now? I'll listen!"

**Test the Apology:**

Animation shows Maya delivering the apology to Leo.

**Leo's Response (based on components selected):**

- If all 4 slots filled correctly: Leo smiles, "Thank you, Maya. Yes, I'll finish my story!" Friendship intact, story continues.
- If 3/4 correct: Leo accepts but still a bit hesitant, "Okay... thanks."
- If 2/4 correct: Leo accepts reluctantly, "I guess..."
- If 0-1 correct: Leo walks away, still hurt

**Bridge Visual:** Shows strength of apology bridge based on components (4/4 = full bridge, 0/4 = broken)

**Sam's Feedback:**

- 4/4: "Perfect apology! All the important parts were there. That's a strong bridge!"
- 2-3/4: "Good start, but some parts were missing. Let's see what could make it stronger."
- 0-1/4: "This apology didn't repair much. Let's look at what was missing."

**Scoring:** +50 points for 4/4 components, +35 for 3/4, +20 for 2/4, +10 for trying

### ****SCENARIO 2: The Borrowed Book****

**SLOT 4 - Make It Right:**

- A) "Can I help repair it with tape? Or can I help you get another copy?" ✓
- B) "I'll buy you a new one." (good, but expensive-not always realistic for kids)
- C) "Sorry about that." ✗ (no repair action)

**Test Apology:**

If 4/4 components: Zoe accepts, "Thank you for being honest. Yes, let's tape it together." They repair book, friendship strengthened.

**Scoring:** Points based on components selected

### ****SCENARIO 3: The Excluded Friend****

**Mistake:** Maya and other friends played a game at recess and didn't invite Leo.

**Effect:** Leo sat alone, felt left out and hurt.

**Build Your Apology:**

(Same structure: 4 component slots)

**Best Apology:** "We didn't invite you to play, which made you feel left out and sad. We should have included you. Next time, we'll make sure to ask if you want to join. Want to play with us now?"

**Test:** If complete, Leo joins happily and game continues with everyone included.

### ****SCENARIO 4: The Careless Words****

**Mistake:** Maya said Leo's drawing was "weird" in front of others.

**Effect:** Leo felt embarrassed and hurt, stopped drawing.

**Build Your Apology:**

**Best Apology:** "I said your drawing was weird, which hurt your feelings and embarrassed you. I shouldn't have said something unkind about your work. Next time, I'll think before I speak and say kind things or nothing. Your drawing is actually really creative."

**Test:** If complete, Leo feels better, "Thank you. That did hurt. I'm glad you understand now."

### ****SCENARIO 5: The Rushed Help****

**Mistake:** Maya agreed to help Zoe with a project but rushed through it carelessly.

**Effect:** Project was messy, Zoe had to redo it, felt like Maya didn't care.

**Build Your Apology:**

**Best Apology:** "I rushed when I said I'd help you, which made the project messy and made you feel like I didn't care. I should have taken my time or said I couldn't help if I was rushing. Can I help you properly now? I'll focus this time."

**Test:** If complete, Zoe accepts, "Yes, let's do it right together."

### ****SCENARIO 6: The Broken Promise****

**Mistake:** Maya promised to save Leo a seat at lunch but forgot and sat with others.

**Effect:** Leo had nowhere to sit, felt disappointed and alone, trust damaged.

**Build Your Apology:**

**Best Apology:** "I promised to save you a seat but forgot, which left you alone and disappointed. I broke your trust. Next time, I'll write a reminder or do what I promise right away. I'm sorry. Let's sit together at the next meal, and I'll make sure there's a seat."

**Test:** If complete, Leo slowly rebuilds trust, "Okay. But please remember next time."

### ****APOLOGY COMPARISON LAB:****

After all 6 scenarios, game shows comparison screen:

**"Apology Strength Analysis"**

Shows all 6 apologies built side-by-side:

- Scenario 1: \[Components included: 4/4\] → Bridge: Full ✓
- Scenario 2: \[Components included: 3/4\] → Bridge: Mostly complete
- Scenario 3: \[Components included: 4/4\] → Bridge: Full ✓
- (etc.)

**Pattern Recognition:**

Sam appears: "Look at this data! When your apologies had all 4 parts, what happened?"

- Full repair of relationship
- Person felt heard and understood
- Problem solved, learning happened

"When parts were missing, what happened?"

- Relationship still strained
- Person still hurt
- Problem not fully resolved

**The Apology Formula:**

Display the complete formula on screen:

\*\*Meaningful Apology = \*\*

- Name what YOU did (action)
- Say how it affected them (effect)
- Explain what you'll do differently (learning)
- Offer to make it right (repair)

**Sam's Teaching Moment:**

"Empty apologies like 'sorry' don't work because they skip steps. Blame-shifting apologies like 'sorry, BUT...' make it worse. Complete apologies show you understand what happened, care about the effect, and are learning."

**Interactive Challenge:**

"Now build your OWN apology scenario!"

- Player can input: What mistake did you make?
- Build custom apology using 4-component template
- Save to personal journal
- Option to practice with family member

### Continuity Note

This game completes Unit 9's home game sequence by focusing on the "Make It Right" step of mistake recovery (from Game 4A). The apology construction mechanic provides concrete skill practice-students learn exactly what makes apologies effective versus ineffective. Sam, Maya, Leo, and Zoe all appear together, showing relationship repair in action. The bridge metaphor ties to earlier ripple/chain metaphors from Games 1-3. This final game synthesizes the entire unit: actions create effects, small actions accumulate, we choose intentionally, and when choices don't work, we recover through meaningful repair. Students now have a complete action-impact framework grounded in psychology science.

## How Lesson 4 Fits into the Full Learning Arc
Lesson 4 concludes Unit 9 by showing students that **mistakes are not endpoints but turning points**—moments where minds learn, adjust, and repair impact. After exploring ripples (Lesson 1), accumulation (Lesson 2), and intentional choice-making (Lesson 3), Lesson 4 completes the action-impact cycle by teaching students what to do *when* choices don't work as intended.

- **Lesson 1:** Introduced cause and effect, helping students notice that every action produces an impact.
- **Lesson 2:** Showed that small actions add up over time, shaping long-term results.
- **Lesson 3:** Strengthened intentionality by teaching students to choose actions based on predicted effects.
- **Lesson 4 (this lesson):** Adds the essential skill of recovery—recognizing mismatches, making things right, and trying differently.

> Together, the lessons form a complete psychological toolkit: students understand how actions create effects, how patterns build over time, how to choose wisely, and how to recover when things go wrong. By ending with mistake-recovery, Unit 9 reinforces resilience and self-efficacy—showing children that progress comes not from perfection, but from learning, adjusting, and continuing forward.
