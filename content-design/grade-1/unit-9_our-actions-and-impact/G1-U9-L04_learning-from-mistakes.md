# Lesson 4: Learning from Mistakes

## Lesson Objective
Students will **reframe mistakes as learning feedback** within the action–effect system.  
They will practise the mistake-learning sequence *(Action → Unwanted Effect → Notice → Make Right → Try Differently)* and recognise that mistakes provide **information to adjust future choices**, not signs of failure.

---

## Warm-Up (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *Mistake Detective*

Show 2–3 simple images:
- Spilled juice on a table  
- A knocked-over block tower  
- Someone sitting alone at lunch (unintentionally excluded)

Ask:
> “What action happened here? What was the effect? Did it work out the way someone hoped?”

For each:
- Discuss what could be learned and what could be done differently.
  - “Pour more carefully.”  
  - “Stack smaller towers.”  
  - “Notice when someone’s alone and invite them.”

**Teacher Close:**  
> “Today we’re going to discover that mistakes aren’t bad — they’re information. Your brain learns from them so you can try something better next time.”

**Teacher Note:** This reframes mistakes as data, not failure — a core growth mindset idea.

## Explore + Practice (30 minutes)

### Explore A: In-Class Psychology Experiment – Mistake Learning Sequence (8 min)

**Type:** Psychology Experiment — *Action → Effect → Adjustment Cycle*  
**Materials:** Scenario cards, role-play space

**Setup:** 3 stations showing a complete mistake-learning cycle.

**Example Stations:**
1. **Accidentally Hurting a Friend’s Feelings**  
   - Action: Said something unkind  
   - Unwanted Effect: Friend sad  
   - Notice → Make Right → Try Differently
2. **Accidentally Breaking a Tower**  
   - Action: Running indoors, bumped into tower  
   - Effect: Tower fell, classmate upset
3. **Forgetting to Return a Book**  
   - Action: Borrowed and forgot  
   - Effect: Friend couldn’t use it

**Teacher Facilitation:**  
- Students act out or observe the sequence.  
- After each: “What was the action? The effect? What did they learn? What will they try differently?”  
- Emphasise: “The child didn’t just feel bad. They noticed, made it right, and changed what they’ll do next.”

### Explore B: Video – Famous Mistakes & Learning (3 min)

**Media:** YouTube video  
**Title:** *“Great Inventions Started with Mistakes”* (TED-Ed for Kids) or *“Mistakes Help You Learn”* (SciShow Kids)  
**Link:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMyAT_IIx3E *(or similar)*  
**Length:** ~3 minutes

> **Note:** This video is *indicative only*. In the full MindMaster version, a copyright-free or modified video will be featured to illustrate how mistakes lead to discovery and learning.

**Teacher Facilitation:**  
1. Play video. Pause to highlight moments where inventors made mistakes and learned from them.  
2. Ask: “What mistake happened? What did they learn? What new thing did they create?”  
3. Connect to classroom: “Your mistakes might not invent something famous, but they help you learn and try better actions next time.”

### Practice A: Guided Role-Play – Making Things Right (8 min)

**Activity:** *The Apology & Adjustment Cycle*  
**Materials:** Scenario cards, classroom space

**Teaching Frame:** Difference between **empty** and **meaningful** apologies.

- Empty: “I’m sorry.” (no learning)
- Meaningful: “I [action], which made [effect]. Next time, I’ll [different action].”

**Model Scenario:** Excluding someone from a game.  
- Action: “I didn’t include you.”  
- Effect: “You felt left out.”  
- Adjustment: “Next time I’ll ask you to join.”

**Additional Scenarios:**  
- Taking someone’s snack  
- Saying something mean

**Teacher Facilitation:**  
- Act out with volunteers or puppets.  
- After each: “Did this apology show learning? How?”  
- Emphasise: “A real apology means you understand what you did, why it hurt, and what you’ll do differently.”

### Practice B: Mistake Analysis Activity – The Learning Questions (7 min)

**Activity:** *Mistake Detective – Asking the Right Questions*  
**Materials:** Scenario cards, chart paper

**The Five Learning Questions:**  
1. What was the action?  
2. What was the effect?  
3. Was it an accident or a choice?  
4. What could I do differently?  
5. What did I learn?

**Guided Scenarios:**  
- Knocking over someone’s art project  
- Forgetting to water the class plant

**Teacher Facilitation:**  
- Walk students through the questions.  
- Record answers on chart.  
- Reinforce that mistakes give *information to act differently*.

### Practice C: MindMaster In-Class Game – Mistake Recovery Quest (6 min)

**Format:** Branching scenarios (choose a response)  
**Materials:** MindMaster app, clickers

**Game Flow:**  
1. Show a mistake scenario on screen.  
2. Students choose between:
   - A) Make it right  
   - B) Ignore it  
   - C) Make it worse
3. Reveal outcomes, award points for helpful choices.
4. Repeat with 4 scenarios (e.g., spilling paint, forgetting birthday, leaving mess, saying something mean).

**Win Condition:** Score 4/4 helpful choices = “Mistake Recovery Expert!”

**How This Connects:** Practises “Make It Right” step of the learning cycle. Students learn that responses can either repair, ignore, or worsen a situation.

## MindMaster In-Class Quiz – Mistake Learning (5 minutes)

**Format:** True/False + image identification  
**Materials:** MindMaster app, clickers

**Sample Questions:**  
1. “A mistake means you’re a bad person.” (False)  
2. [Image: rebuilding blocks] “What is this child doing?” → B. Making it right  
3. “The best thing to do with mistakes is hide them.” (False)  
4. [Image: meaningful apology] “This is a …” → B. Meaningful apology showing learning  
5. “Mistakes help your brain learn how to do things better.” (True)

**Scoring:** 1 point per correct answer. Celebrate effort, not perfection.

## Reflection (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *My Mistake, My Learning*

**Prompt:**  
> “Think of a mistake you made recently. What happened? What did you learn?”

**Reflection Flow:**  
- Students choose from options (e.g., forgot something, hurt someone’s feelings, broke something, said something unkind).  
- Then select what they learned (e.g., be more careful, think before acting, make things right, mistakes help me grow).  
- Optional: 2–3 students share aloud.

**Teacher Close:**  
> “You don’t have to be perfect. You just have to be willing to learn when things don’t work out. That’s how you grow.”

## Home Prep (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *MindMaster Family Mistake Discussion*

**Instructions for families:**  
- Ask a family member: “Tell me about a mistake you made. What happened? What did you learn?”  
- Share your own story from school.  
- Play the *‘Learning from Mistakes’* reflection game together on MindMaster.  
- Talk afterward: “Why do mistakes help us learn? What will you try differently next time?”

**Teacher Note:** This normalises mistakes at home and shows students that adults learn from mistakes too.

## Connection to Unit Arc

Lesson 4 completes the action-impact framework:
- Lesson 1: Actions create effects.  
- Lesson 2: Small repeated actions accumulate.  
- Lesson 3: We can choose actions intentionally.  
- Lesson 4: When actions don’t work as expected, **mistakes become learning opportunities**.  

This prepares students for Unit 10, where they apply action-awareness in collaborative, community contexts.
