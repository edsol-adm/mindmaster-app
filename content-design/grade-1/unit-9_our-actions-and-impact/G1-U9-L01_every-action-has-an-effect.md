# Lesson 1: Every Action Has an Effect

## Lesson Objective
Students will identify everyday **cause-and-effect relationships**, recognising that their actions create effects — sometimes immediately, sometimes over time — and that these effects shape what happens to themselves, others, and their environment.

---

## Warm-Up (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *Ripple Exploration*

Gather students in a circle. Show a small bowl of water and a pebble. Ask:  
> “What happens when I drop this pebble into water?”  

Drop it and pause.  
> “What do you see?” (Ripples spreading out.)

Explain:  
> “Ripples move outward in circles, getting bigger and wider. Today, we’re going to discover that actions work like ripples too. When we do something, it creates effects that spread out — sometimes we see them right away, sometimes later.”

Ask:  
> “Who can give me an example of something you did that had an effect? What happened after?”

Listen to 2–3 responses (e.g., “I threw a ball and it hit something,” “I helped my friend and they were happy”).  
Affirm each as an action-effect pair.

**Teacher Note:** This prepares students to think in terms of cause-and-effect systems. Use the ripple metaphor throughout the lesson.

## Explore + Practice (30 minutes)

### Explore A: Video Introduction to Cause and Effect (5 min)

**Media:** YouTube video  
**Title:** *“Cause and Effect for Kids”* (SciShow Kids)  
**Link:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vf5hVQb6P8Q  
**Length:** ~3 minutes  

> **Note:** This video is *indicative only*. In the full MindMaster version, a copyright-free or modified video will be featured to illustrate the same concept of cause and effect.

**How to use:**  
1. Play the video. Pause at key moments showing a cause → effect example.  
2. After the video, ask: “What actions did you see? What happened after?”  
3. List 2–3 examples on the board (e.g., dropping an object → it falls; planting a seed → it grows).  
4. Explain: “This is cause and effect. The cause is the action. The effect is what happens.”

### Practice A: In-Class Cause-and-Effect Experiment (7 min)

**Type:** Psychology Experiment — *Action → Immediate Effect Observation*

**Materials:** Hard copy / classroom resources

**Setup:** Divide the class into four small stations. Each station has a simple scenario where an action has an immediate, observable effect.

**Stations (rotate or assign groups):**

- **Station 1 – Dropping & Falling:** Drop a pencil from different heights; observe how far it rolls. *(Action: drop; Effect: falls and rolls)*  
- **Station 2 – Sound Maker:** Ring a bell, shake a tambourine, clap loudly. *(Action: make noise; Effect: sound travels, others hear it)*  
- **Station 3 – Block Towers:** Stack blocks carefully, then knock one over gently. *(Action: knock block; Effect: tower falls or wobbles)*  
- **Station 4 – Helping Hands:** One student drops books; another picks them up. *(Action: help; Effect: books are picked up, helper feels helpful)*

**Steps:**  
1. Teacher describes the station task.  
2. Student(s) perform the action.  
3. Observe the effect together.  
4. Ask: “What was the action? What was the effect?”  
5. Record on a simple sheet: “Action: _____. Effect: _____.”

**Teacher Note:** Keep it brief and observable. The goal is to see that every action has an immediate effect.

### Practice B: MindMaster Psychology Game – Cause & Effect Match (8 min)

**Game Format:** Matching Pairs (Memory Flip Game)  
**Materials:** MindMaster app, PC connected to TV, clickers (1 per student)

**Game Flow:**  
- **Setup:** Display 8 pairs of cards on screen. One side shows an action image (e.g., watering a plant, sharing a toy), the other shows an effect image (e.g., plant looks happy, friend smiles). Cards are face-down.  
- **Play:** Students work together as a class. Call on students to flip two cards by number (e.g., “Flip card 1 and card 6”). The class votes using clickers: Does this action-effect pair match? (1 = Yes, 2 = No)  
- **Scoring:** Correct matches earn 1 point per pair. Incorrect guesses reset those cards.  
- **Win Condition:** Match all 8 pairs before the timer ends (3 minutes).

**How This Connects:** This game consolidates the action-effect pairs students observed during Practice A. It requires them to predict: “Will this action-effect pair match?” (applying causal reasoning).

### Practice C: Guided Discovery – Delayed Effects (10 min)

**Materials:** Hard copy / story cards or picture sequence

**Activity:** *Planting a Seed Story*

Show a simple picture sequence (3–4 images):  
1. Child plants a seed in soil.  
2. Child waters the seed each day (over several days).  
3. A sprout appears (days later).  
4. A flower blooms (weeks later).

**Teacher Facilitation:**  
- Point to Image 1: “What is the action?” (Planting a seed)  
- “What happens right after?” (Nothing visible yet — effect is delayed)  
- Point to Image 4: “This is the effect. But it takes time. Days pass.”  
- Ask: “Why does the effect take time?” (Seeds need water, sunlight, time to grow)

**Guided Questions:**  
- “Can you think of an action in your life that has an effect right away?” (e.g., closing a door → it’s closed)  
- “Can you think of an action that has an effect that takes time?” (e.g., practising an instrument → getting better over weeks)

**Board Setup:**  
- Immediate effects (top column)  
- Delayed effects (bottom column)

**Teacher Note:** This distinguishes immediate and delayed effects, preparing for Lesson 2’s focus on how small repeated actions accumulate.

## MindMaster In-Class Quiz (5 minutes)

**Format:** True/False Quick Fire  
**Materials:** MindMaster app, clickers

**Quiz Flow:**  
1. Setup: 5 statements appear on screen one by one. Each statement is a cause-and-effect claim (some true, some false).  
2. Students tap Button 1 (True) or Button 2 (False) on their clickers.  
3. Feedback: After each answer, the correct answer is revealed.  
4. Scoring: 1 point per correct answer. No penalty for incorrect answers.

**Sample Statements:**  
- “When you help a friend carry books, they might feel happy.” (True)  
- “Actions always have an effect right away.” (False)  
- “A seed you plant will become a flower in one day.” (False)  
- “When you share a toy, another child might want to play with you.” (True)  
- “Actions are like ripples in water — they spread out.” (True)

**How This Connects:** The quiz reinforces the core idea that actions create effects (some immediate, some delayed). It checks understanding before reflection.

## Reflection (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *Think–Pair–Share: My Own Action-Effect*

- **Think (1 min):** “Think of an action you did today (at home, in class, anywhere). What was the effect?”  
- **Pair (2 min):** Partner A shares their action-effect to Partner B. Partner B listens and asks: “So the effect was...?”  
- **Share (2 min):** Call on 2–3 pairs to share with the whole class. Write on board:  
  - “Action: [Student name] shared crayons. Effect: Friend said ‘thank you.’”  
  - “Action: [Student name] ran fast. Effect: I got tired.”

**Teacher Close:**  
> “Every action you make creates an effect. Sometimes you see it right away. Sometimes it takes time. But your actions matter because they shape what happens next. That’s real power.”

## Home Prep (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *MindMaster Homework Setup (Optional/Engagement)*

Explain to students:  
> “Tonight, we’re going to use an app called MindMaster at home if you can. It’s like the games we played today, but you can do it on a tablet or computer.”

**Instructions for parents/caregivers:**  
- Help your child log into MindMaster at home.  
- Your child will play a short *‘Cause and Effect Hunt’* game where they spot action-effect pairs in images.  
- The game takes about 5 minutes.  
- When they finish, ask: “What actions did you see? What were the effects?”  
- Bring their score or notes back to school tomorrow.

**Teacher Note:** Home Prep introduces the MindMaster app as an ongoing learning tool. It bridges the lesson into students’ homes and builds familiarity with the platform for future lessons.

## Connection to Unit Arc

Lesson 1 builds the foundation: Students understand that actions create effects (cause-and-effect systems).  
Lesson 2 builds on this by showing that small, repeated actions accumulate into larger effects — moving from single action-effect pairs to patterns over time.
