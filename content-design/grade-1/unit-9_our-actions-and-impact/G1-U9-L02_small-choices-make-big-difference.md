# Lesson 2: Small Choices Make a Big Difference

## Lesson Objective
Students will understand that **repeated small actions accumulate** to create larger patterns and outcomes.  
They will recognise that even small, everyday choices carry real weight in shaping what happens for themselves, others, and their environment.

---

## Warm-Up (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *Seed Growth Visualisation*

Hold up a small seed (real or image). Ask:  
> “Is this seed big or small?” (Small)  
> “If I plant this seed and water it a tiny bit each day, what happens?”

Show a simple image sequence: Day 1 (seed), Day 5 (sprout), Day 20 (small plant), Day 60 (tall plant).

Explain:  
> “One tiny action — watering once — doesn’t seem like much. But do it every day, and look what happens. It grows big. Today we’re going to discover that small choices work the same way. A small kind word, a small helpful action, a small choice repeated — it adds up to something big.”

Ask:  
> “Can you think of something small you do every day? What happens when you do it over and over?”

(e.g., brushing teeth → teeth stay clean; being kind → friend stays your friend)

**Teacher Note:** This sets up the “accumulation” concept. The seed is a powerful metaphor for this lesson.

## Explore + Practice (30 minutes)

### Explore A: MindMaster Psychology Experiment – Pattern Recognition Game (7 min)

**Type:** Psychology Experiment — *Cumulative Effects Test*  
**Materials:** MindMaster app, clickers, PC connected to TV

**Game Name:** *“Spot the Pattern”* — recognising how small repeated actions create patterns.

**Game Flow:**  
- **Setup:** Screen shows a sequence of small images representing repeated actions over time. Example sequences:  
  - Tidy desk each day → desk stays organised  
  - Kind word to friend each day → strong friendship  
  - Forgetting to water plant → plant droops  
- **Play:** For each sequence, students predict the outcome. Display 3 choices on screen (1 = Nothing changes, 2 = Big positive effect, 3 = Big negative effect).  
- **Scoring:** 1 point per correct prediction.  
- **Win Condition:** 3 out of 3 correct predictions = full success. Display score.  
- **Teacher Facilitation:** After each sequence, reveal the answer and ask: “Why did that happen? The action was small, but the effect was big — why?”

**How This Connects:** This experiment teaches students to recognise patterns of accumulation — the core insight for this lesson.

### Practice A: Video – Small Actions, Big Impact (4 min)

**Media:** YouTube video  
**Title:** *“Every Drop Counts”* (National Geographic Kids) or *“Small Actions, Big Changes”* (TED-Ed for Kids)  
**Link:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSIrXi7aqhk *(or similar)*  
**Length:** ~2–3 minutes

> **Note:** This video is *indicative only*. In the full MindMaster version, a copyright-free or modified video will be featured to illustrate the concept of small daily actions creating large impacts over time.

**Teacher Facilitation:**  
1. Play the video. Pause at key moments showing small individual actions and their cumulative effect (e.g., many people saving water → big water conservation).  
2. Ask: “What small action did you see? What happened when many people did it?”  
3. Connect to classroom: “If everyone in our class picks up one piece of litter each day, what happens to our classroom over a week?”

### Practice B: Guided Discovery – Accumulation Charts (10 min)

**Materials:** Chart paper, markers, classroom examples

**Activity:** *Build an Accumulation Story*

Present 3 real-life scenarios. For each, students predict what happens when a small action is repeated.

- **Scenario 1: Daily Kindness**  
  Day 1: Say “good morning” → friend smiles  
  Day 5: Friend thinks you’re kind  
  Day 30: You’re good friends

- **Scenario 2: Daily Responsibility**  
  Day 1: Put toys away → room tidy  
  Day 5: Room stays tidy  
  Day 30: Always organised

- **Scenario 3: Daily Carelessness** (contrast example)  
  Day 1: Leave tap running a little bit  
  Day 5: More water wasted  
  Day 30: Big problem

**Teacher Facilitation:**  
- Record each on a chart:  
  *1 small action × many days = big outcome*  
- Ask: “Which scenario shows a helpful pattern? Which shows an unhelpful pattern?”  
- Emphasise: “The action is tiny. But time + repetition = big effect.”

### Practice C: Role-Play Stations – Accumulation in Action (9 min)

**Materials:** Scenario cards, simple classroom props

**Activity:** *Acting Out Patterns*

Set up 2 stations. Each station has a scenario card with a small repeated action. Students role-play the sequence over three “days.”

- **Station 1: Helping Out**  
  - Day 1: Help a classmate with a puzzle.  
  - Day 2: Classmate says “You’re a good helper!”  
  - Day 3: Best friends.  
  → *Effect: Helpfulness builds trust and friendship.*

- **Station 2: Ignoring**  
  - Day 1: Don’t include someone in a game.  
  - Day 2: Ignore them again.  
  - Day 3: They sit alone.  
  → *Effect: Repeated ignoring damages relationships.*

**Teacher Facilitation:**  
Have 2–3 pairs act out each scenario in front of the class.  
After each: “What small action repeated? What big effect happened?”  
Emphasise: “You saw the effect grow over time. That’s what happens in real life too.”

## MindMaster In-Class Game – Accumulation Builder (4 min)

**Format:** Sequence Builder (Drag-to-arrange or Multiple-Choice)  
**Materials:** MindMaster app, clickers

**Game Flow:**  
- **Setup:** Present a story in scrambled order. Students must arrange it to show accumulation over time. Example: plant growing from seed to flower (6 stages mixed up).  
- **Play:** Students vote on correct order.  
- **Scoring:** Correct sequence = 2 points; bonus point for time limit.  
- **Win Condition:** Complete 2–3 sequences before time ends. Display final score.

**How This Connects:** Reinforces that small actions, when repeated in order, build up to bigger effects. Sequencing requires students to understand cause-and-effect progression.

## MindMaster In-Class Quiz (5 minutes)

**Format:** Multiple Choice  
**Materials:** MindMaster app, clickers

**Quiz Flow:**  
- **Setup:** 4 questions appear on screen. Each question tests accumulation logic.  
- **Play:** Students tap clicker button for their answer.  
- **Scoring:** 1 point per correct answer.  
- **Feedback:** Reveal correct response and explain briefly.

**Sample Questions:**  
1. “If you say ‘thank you’ to your friend every day, what might happen over time?”  
 A. Nothing B. Strong friendship C. They get annoyed  
 ✅ Correct: B

2. “A small action done once creates a big effect.”  
 ✅ Correct: False

3. “If you forget to turn off the light before bed one night, what happens?”  
 A. The room is bright B. A tiny bit of energy is wasted C. Something terrible happens  
 ✅ Correct: B

4. “Repeated small actions can build into big patterns.”  
 ✅ Correct: True

## Reflection (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *Personal Accumulation Commitment*

Prompt students:  
> “Think of one small action you can repeat this week. It could be something kind, something helpful, something good for the environment, or something that takes care of yourself. What will it be?”

- Students write or draw their action on a card (e.g., “I will pick up one toy each night,” “I will say good morning to someone each day”).  
- Invite 2–3 students to share aloud.

**Teacher Close:**  
> “You’ve just promised to create an effect through repetition. By next week, watch what happens. Small actions add up. That’s your superpower.”

---

## Home Prep (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *MindMaster Reflection at Home*

Explain:  
> “Tonight, you’ll use MindMaster to reflect. You’ll look at pictures of small actions and think about what big effects they create over time.”

**Instructions for families:**  
- Log into MindMaster at home (link sent to parents).  
- Play the *“Small Actions, Big Effects”* reflection game (about 5 min).  
- After playing, talk together: “What small actions do we do at home over and over? What big effects do they create?”  
- Examples: brushing teeth (healthy teeth), tidying (neat home), reading together (love and learning).  
- Report back: “What small action did you find at home?”

**Teacher Note:** This home prep makes the concept personal and involves families in recognising accumulation patterns in their own lives.

## Connection to Unit Arc

Lesson 2 expands Lesson 1: Students move from single cause–effect pairs to understanding that small repeated actions create larger patterns over time.  
Lesson 3 builds on this by teaching students to choose their actions intentionally — selecting which small repeated actions to take in order to create desired effects.
