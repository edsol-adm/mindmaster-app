# Grade 1 · Unit 9 — Our Actions and Impact

**Purpose**  
This unit teaches children that **actions are part of a cause-and-effect system** that shapes what happens to themselves, others, and their environment.  
Through stories, experiments, and interactive scenarios, students learn that their choices matter because they **set things in motion**—like ripples in water.

They begin by noticing everyday cause–effect patterns, then explore how **small actions accumulate**, how **intentional choices can shape outcomes**, and how **mistakes provide feedback** for learning and repair. This helps children build a sense of agency, responsibility, and resilience.

By the end of the unit, students understand that:
- Every action has an effect, sometimes immediate, sometimes delayed.  
- Repeated small actions can create **powerful patterns** over time.  
- We can **choose helpful actions intentionally** to support ourselves and others.  
- When actions produce unhelpful outcomes, **mistakes are learning opportunities**, not failures.  

This mindset shifts children from passive reactions to **active decision-making**, preparing them for responsible participation in social and environmental systems.

**Theory of Change**  
> **Knowledge** — Students learn to identify and explain **cause-and-effect relationships** in everyday life. They discover that actions set events in motion, shaping people’s feelings, relationships, and the environment. They also learn that the **timing of effects** (immediate vs. delayed) and **pattern accumulation** are central to understanding how change unfolds (Flavell; Posner & Rothbart).  
> **→ Self-efficacy** — Through structured observation, experiments, and gameplay, children **see their choices produce real outcomes**. By predicting consequences and making intentional decisions, they develop **executive self-efficacy**—confidence in their ability to regulate their actions and shape results (Bandura; Zimmerman; Schunk).  
> **→ Mental resilience** — By normalising mistakes as information and practising **repair and re-try strategies**, children build tolerance for setbacks and frustration. They experience that problems can be addressed, effects can be changed over time, and learning continues even after missteps. This strengthens emotional regulation, persistence, and empathy (Dweck; Masten).

Together these stages help students shift from **unconscious action** to **intentional agency**—laying the groundwork for responsible citizenship, self-regulation, and adaptive coping.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this unit, students will be able to:

1. **Recognise** everyday cause-and-effect links in actions and outcomes.  
2. **Differentiate** between immediate and delayed effects.  
3. **Explain** how repeated small actions build larger patterns over time.  
4. **Choose** helpful actions intentionally by predicting consequences.  
5. **Reframe mistakes** as opportunities for learning, repair, and trying again.  
6. **Demonstrate responsibility** for their actions toward themselves, others, and the environment.

## Lesson Sequence
1. **L01 — Every Action Has an Effect**  
   Understanding the ripple effect of actions and outcomes.  

2. **L02 — Small Choices Make a Big Difference**  
   Exploring how small repeated actions accumulate into bigger patterns.  

3. **L03 — Choosing Helpful Actions**  
   Learning to intentionally select actions by predicting their consequences.  

4. **L04 — Learning from Mistakes**  
   Seeing mistakes as feedback loops that guide learning and future decisions.

## Digital & Interactive Components (MindMaster)
- **Psychology Experiments** – Cause–effect and accumulation tests (*Ripple Effect Stations*, *Spot the Pattern*, *Decision Tree Simulation*, *Mistake Recovery Quest*) that allow students to observe how actions lead to outcomes.  
- **MindMaster Games** – Scenario-based clicker activities (*Cause & Effect Match*, *Accumulation Builder*, *Helpful Choice Matcher*) that make abstract concepts concrete and playful.  
- **Quizzes** – Multiple-choice and True/False quick checks that reinforce key ideas about intentionality and consequence.  
- **Reflections** – Clicker-based Think–Pair–Share and confidence-rating activities (*My Own Action-Effect*, *Personal Accumulation Commitment*, *Choice Reflection Game*, *My Mistake, My Learning*) to connect learning with daily experience.  
- **Teacher Dashboard** – Visualises class-level trends in cause–effect understanding, decision-making patterns, and response to mistakes.

## Connection to Curriculum Arc
Unit 9 follows **Unit 8: Problems Are Part of Life**, which equipped students with structured strategies for managing challenges.  
Now they extend this understanding into **intentional action**, discovering how their everyday choices shape not only their personal experience but also their social and environmental surroundings.

This unit represents a developmental step:
- From **problem-solving strategies** (Unit 8)  
- To **agency and responsibility** (Unit 9)  

Students develop:
- **Causal reasoning** — understanding how actions and consequences connect over time.  
- **Self-regulation** — making intentional choices rather than reactive ones.  
- **Resilience and empathy** — reframing mistakes as learning opportunities.  
- **Social responsibility** — recognising their impact on others and the environment.

Together, these capacities help children transition from *“I can solve problems”* to *“I can shape what happens through my actions”*—a foundational mindset for civic responsibility and personal resilience.
