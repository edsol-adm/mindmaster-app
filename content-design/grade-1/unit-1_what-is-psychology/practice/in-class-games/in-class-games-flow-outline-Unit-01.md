## In-Class-Game 1A – Mind Parts Detective

**Lesson:** 01.01 - How Our Minds Work  

### Lesson Link & Learning Objective

**Objective:** Identify the three parts of the mind-Thinking, Feeling, and Doing-and give one example of each from daily life. Recognize which part of the mind is active in common scenarios.

### Game File Name: icg-01.01-game01.html

### Game Title: ****Mind Part Detective****

### Game Format: ****Classification Trees / Gallery****

**Format Justification:** This format has 0 uses across all units and is ideal for teaching students to systematically categorize mental experiences into the three mind parts (Thinking, Feeling, Doing). The gallery/tree structure allows students to observe multiple examples and classify them step-by-step, building pattern recognition skills essential for understanding the mind framework. Unlike simple matching, this format requires deliberate sorting through categories, reinforcing the distinct characteristics of each mind part through repeated classification decisions.

### Purpose: Students observe everyday scenarios and classify them into the three mind parts (Idea Factory, Messenger, Action Player), strengthening their ability to distinguish between thinking, feeling, and doing through systematic categorization practice

### Lesson Arc Location****:**** Part C of Lesson 1 (approximately minutes 17-27 in the 45-minute lesson)

**Pedagogical Rationale:** This game is placed immediately after students have been introduced to the three mind parts in Part A and watched the Inside Out video demonstration. At this point, students understand the basic concept but need practice distinguishing between the three categories. The Classification Trees format provides structured, repetitive practice in categorization-the core skill needed before advancing to understanding reciprocal loops in Part D. By requiring students to sort multiple examples through a gallery interface, they build fluency with the framework vocabulary and develop pattern recognition that will support all future psychology learning.

### Setup

**Starting Screen:**

- Background: Bright, clean laboratory setting with three large sorting stations visible
- Title at top: "Mind Part Detective Challenge"
- Subtitle: "Help sort these everyday moments into the right mind part!"
- Three labeled stations displayed horizontally across screen:
  - **Station 1:** "IDEA FACTORY" (with lightbulb icon, yellow color theme)
  - **Station 2:** "MESSENGER" (with envelope/signal icon, blue color theme)
  - **Station 3:** "ACTION PLAYER" (with running figure icon, green color theme)
- Center of screen: Empty sorting area with text "Click START to begin sorting!"
- Bottom: "START SORTING" button (Button 5 on clicker)

**First Interaction:** Student presses Button 5 (START) to begin the challenge. First scenario card appears in center sorting area.

### Play (Step-by-Step Sequence)

**Round Structure:**  
Game presents 12 scenario cards one at a time. Each card must be sorted into the correct mind part station.

**For Each Scenario Card:**

- **Scenario Presentation:**
  - Card appears in center of screen with simple illustration + text description
  - Voice reads scenario aloud (auto-plays)
  - Three station options remain visible at top of screen
  - Student uses clicker to select which mind part:
    - Button 1 = IDEA FACTORY (Thinking)
    - Button 2 = MESSENGER (Feeling)
    - Button 3 = ACTION PLAYER (Doing)
- **Immediate Feedback:**
  - **If CORRECT:** Card animates smoothly into the correct station with a satisfying "click" sound
    - Text appears: "Correct! \[Scenario\] is \[Mind Part Name\] because \[brief explanation\]."
    - Example: "Correct! Planning what to do at recess is IDEA FACTORY because your mind is making a plan."
  - **If INCORRECT:** Card shakes gently, stays in center
    - Text appears: "Not quite. Think about whether this happens inside your mind or if others can see it."
    - Student gets second attempt (can press any of the 3 buttons again)
    - If incorrect on second attempt, card automatically sorts to correct station with explanation
- **Next Scenario:**
  - After feedback (3 seconds), next scenario card appears
  - Progress indicator shows: "Card \[X\] of 12"

**12 Scenario Cards:**

- **"Planning what game to play at recess"** → IDEA FACTORY
- **"Feeling excited in your stomach"** → MESSENGER
- **"Raising your hand in class"** → ACTION PLAYER
- **"Remembering your friend's name"** → IDEA FACTORY
- **"Smiling at someone"** → ACTION PLAYER
- **"Feeling worried before a test"** → MESSENGER
- **"Walking to the door"** → ACTION PLAYER
- **"Imagining a flying elephant"** → IDEA FACTORY
- **"Feeling happy in your chest"** → MESSENGER
- **"Saying 'thank you' out loud"** → ACTION PLAYER
- **"Solving a puzzle in your mind"** → IDEA FACTORY
- **"Feeling nervous butterflies"** → MESSENGER

**Final Round - Challenge Mode:**  
After completing 12 scenarios, game presents 3 "tricky" scenarios that students must sort without a second attempt:

- **"Choosing to wait quietly"** → ACTION PLAYER (tricky because it's stillness, but it's observable choice)
- **"Wondering what's for lunch"** → IDEA FACTORY (tricky because it feels passive)
- **"Feeling tired in your body"** → MESSENGER (tricky because it's physical sensation)

### Scoring

**Points System:**

- **Correct on first try:** 2 points + card sorts into station
- **Correct on second try:** 1 point + card sorts into station
- **Incorrect both tries:** 0 points, but card still sorts correctly (for learning)
- **Challenge Mode (Cards 13-15):** 3 points each for correct first-try answer

**Total Possible Points:** 27 points

- Regular cards (12 × 2 points) = 24 points
- Challenge cards (3 × 3 points) = 9 points
- Maximum = 33 points (if all correct first try)

**Visual Scoring Display:**

- Running point total displays in top-right corner throughout game
- Each station shows count of sorted cards: "Idea Factory: 5 cards sorted"

### Win Condition

**Completion:**  
Students complete all 15 scenario cards. Game declares completion when final card is sorted.

**Success Tiers:**

- **20+ points:** "Expert Mind Detective! You can tell the three mind parts apart!"
- **15-19 points:** "Good Mind Detective! You're learning the three mind parts well!"
- **10-14 points:** "Mind Detective in Training! Keep practicing to spot the differences!"
- **0-9 points:** "Keep exploring! The three mind parts take practice to learn!"

**End Screen:**

- Shows all three stations filled with sorted cards
- Displays student's total points and tier message
- Summary text: "You sorted \[X\] cards correctly on the first try!"
- Button 5: "RETURN TO LESSON" (links back to lesson-01.01.html)

**Class Summary (Teacher View):**

- App displays class-wide statistics:
  - Average score
  - Most challenging scenario (highest error rate)
  - Percentage of students reaching each tier

### Continuity Note

**Link to Prior Learning:**  
This is the first game in Unit 1, building directly on the Warm-up and Part A introduction to the three mind parts framework. Students have just learned the metaphors (Idea Factory, Messenger, Action Player) and seen them demonstrated.

**Link to Future Learning:**  
This classification practice prepares students for Lesson 2 (exploring Thinking jobs in detail), Lesson 3 (exploring Feeling messages in detail), and Lesson 4 (understanding how the three parts work together in reciprocal loops). Fluency in categorizing mental experiences is foundational for all subsequent psychology learning.

### Estimated Play Time

**8-10 minutes**

- Setup and first scenario: 1 minute
- 12 regular scenarios (30-40 seconds each): 6-8 minutes
- 3 challenge scenarios (20 seconds each): 1 minute
- End screen review: 30 seconds

## In-Class-Game 1B – Idea Factory Job Matcher

## LESSON 2: Thinking - Our Mind's Idea Factory

### Lesson Link & Learning Objective

Identify at least three different types of thinking their Idea Factory does (e.g., remembering, imagining, planning, problem-solving, wondering, deciding) and give an example of each from their own experience. Apply deliberate thinking to solve a simple problem by generating multiple possible solutions before choosing one.

### Game File Name: icg-01.02-game01.html

### Game Title: ****Idea Factory Job Matcher****

### Game Format: ****Matching Pairs (Memory Flip Game)****

**Format Justification:**  
This format has 0 uses across all units and is ideal for teaching students to recognize and match the six different thinking jobs (remembering, imagining, planning, problem-solving, wondering, deciding) with concrete examples from daily life. The memory flip mechanic requires students to hold multiple thinking jobs in working memory while searching for matches-itself a metacognitive exercise that reinforces the lesson's focus on how the Idea Factory works. Unlike simple identification, this format demands active retrieval and comparison, strengthening students' ability to distinguish between similar-seeming thinking types through repeated exposure and matching practice.

### Purpose: Students match thinking job labels (remembering, imagining, planning, problem-solving, wondering, deciding) with everyday scenario examples, strengthening their ability to recognize different types of thinking and understand that the Idea Factory performs multiple distinct jobs

### Lesson Arc Location:****:**** Part C of Lesson 2 (approximately minutes 25-35 in the 45-minute lesson)

**Pedagogical Rationale:** This game is placed after students have been introduced to the five main thinking jobs in Part A and completed the Memory List Test experiment in Part B. At this point, students have learned the vocabulary (remembering, imagining, planning, problem-solving, deciding) but need practice connecting these abstract labels to concrete, relatable situations. The Matching Pairs format provides intensive retrieval practice-students must recall what each thinking job means while searching for matching examples, which deepens their understanding through active mental work. This consolidation prepares them for the final reflection activity where they'll identify thinking jobs in picture scenarios, and builds the foundation for recognizing these thinking types in themselves and others throughout the curriculum.

### Setup

**Starting Screen:**

- Background: Colorful Idea Factory workshop setting with gears, lightbulbs, and thinking clouds
- Title at top: "Idea Factory Job Matcher"
- Subtitle: "Match each thinking job with an example!"
- Center of screen: 12 face-down cards arranged in 3 rows of 4 cards
  - Each card shows identical back design: lightbulb icon with "?" symbol
- Cards are numbered 1-12 for clicker selection
- Bottom left: "Matches Found: 0/6"
- Bottom right: "Moves Used: 0"
- Bottom center: "SELECT TWO CARDS" button active (Button 5 to start)

**Card Layout (numbered for clicker selection):**

Row 1: \[1\] \[2\] \[3\] \[4\]

Row 2: \[5\] \[6\] \[7\] \[8\]

Row 3: \[9\] \[10\] \[11\] \[12\]

**First Interaction:** Student presses Button 5 (SELECT TWO CARDS) to activate card selection mode. Instructions appear: "Press a number to flip your first card!"

### Play (Step-by-Step Sequence)

**Game Mechanics:**

**Round Structure:**  
Game contains 6 pairs (12 cards total). Students flip two cards per turn attempting to find matches.

**The 6 Matching Pairs:**

- **REMEMBERING** (label card) ↔ "What did I eat for breakfast?" (example card)
- **IMAGINING** (label card) ↔ "A purple elephant flying!" (example card)
- **PLANNING** (label card) ↔ "First I'll clean up, then put on my coat" (example card)
- **PROBLEM-SOLVING** (label card) ↔ "My pencil broke-what can I use instead?" (example card)
- **WONDERING** (label card) ↔ "I wonder what's in this box?" (example card)
- **DECIDING** (label card) ↔ "Should I read the red book or blue book?" (example card)

**Turn Sequence:**

- **First Card Selection:**
  - Student presses button 1-9 on clicker to select first card
  - Selected card flips over (animated flip) revealing either:
    - A thinking job LABEL (word in large text with icon), OR
    - An EXAMPLE scenario (illustration + text)
  - Card remains face-up
  - Voice reads card content aloud
- **Second Card Selection:**
  - Student presses different button 1-9 to select second card
  - Second card flips over, revealing its content
  - Voice reads second card content aloud
  - Both cards remain visible for 2 seconds
- **Match Evaluation:**

**If MATCH (thinking job + correct example):**

- - Both cards glow green and slide together with satisfying chime
    - Feedback text appears: "Match! \[Example\] is \[Thinking Job\] because \[brief explanation\]."
      - Example: "Match! 'What did I eat for breakfast?' is REMEMBERING because your Idea Factory is pulling up stored information from earlier."
    - Matched pair moves to "Matches Found" area at bottom
    - Counter updates: "Matches Found: \[X\]/6"
    - Cards removed from play grid (show as blank spaces)

**If NO MATCH:**

- - Both cards wiggle slightly
    - Feedback text appears: "Not a match. Keep trying!"
    - After 2 seconds, both cards flip back face-down automatically
    - Cards return to original positions in grid
    - "Moves Used" counter increases by 1

- **Next Turn:**
  - Game returns to card selection mode
  - Student presses Button 5 (if needed to reactivate) and selects two new cards
  - Process repeats until all 6 pairs are found

**Strategic Hint (appears after 4 unsuccessful moves):**

- Text banner: "Thinking Tip: Your Idea Factory is REMEMBERING where cards are! Use that thinking job to help you match!"

### Scoring

**Efficiency-Based Scoring System:**

**Moves Tracking:**

- Game tracks total number of moves (two-card flips) used to complete all matches
- Minimum possible moves: 6 (if student matches perfectly on first 6 tries)
- Each unsuccessful pair = 1 additional move

**Star Rating System:**

- **3 Stars (Expert Thinker):** Complete in 6-9 moves
- **2 Stars (Strong Thinker):** Complete in 10-13 moves
- **1 Star (Learning Thinker):** Complete in 14+ moves

**Points System (optional, displayed but not emphasized):**

- Each match found: 10 points
- Bonus points for efficiency:
  - 3-star completion: +30 bonus points
  - 2-star completion: +20 bonus points
  - 1-star completion: +10 bonus points
- Total possible: 60 points (6 matches) + 30 bonus = 90 points maximum

**Visual Feedback:**

- "Moves Used" counter visible throughout
- "Matches Found: X/6" progress indicator
- Star rating revealed only at end screen

### Win Condition

**Completion:**  
Students complete the game when all 6 pairs are successfully matched. Game automatically advances to end screen when final pair is found.

**End Screen Display:**

**Success Message Based on Star Rating:**

- **3 Stars:** "Expert Thinker! Your Idea Factory remembered card locations and matched jobs quickly!"
- **2 Stars:** "Strong Thinker! Your Idea Factory used REMEMBERING to find most matches!"
- **1 Star:** "Learning Thinker! Your Idea Factory practiced six different thinking jobs today!"

**Summary Display:**

- Large star rating graphic (1, 2, or 3 stars)
- "You completed the challenge in \[X\] moves"
- "You discovered all 6 thinking jobs your Idea Factory does!"
- Scrollable review panel showing all 6 matched pairs with mini-illustrations

**Reflection Prompt:**

- Text: "Which thinking job did YOU just use while playing this game?"
- Four options appear (clicker buttons 1-4):
  - REMEMBERING (remembering where cards were)
  - PLANNING (planning which cards to flip)
  - PROBLEM-SOLVING (figuring out matches)
  - ALL THREE!
- Correct answer: Button 4 (ALL THREE!)
- Feedback: "Yes! Your Idea Factory used multiple thinking jobs at once. That's how thinking really works!"

**Exit:**

- Button 5: "RETURN TO LESSON" (links back to lesson-01.02.html)

**Class Summary (Teacher View):**

- Average moves to completion
- Star rating distribution
- Most commonly confused pairs (highest error rate)
- Percentage selecting "ALL THREE" on reflection question

### Continuity Note

**Link to Prior Learning:**  
This game builds on Lesson 1's introduction to Thinking as one of three mind parts. Students now explore the internal diversity of the Idea Factory-that thinking isn't just one thing, but includes multiple distinct jobs.

**Link to Future Learning:**  
This understanding of varied thinking jobs prepares students for recognizing when different thinking types are useful (Lesson 4's "thinking before acting"), understanding how thinking influences feeling and doing in reciprocal loops, and developing metacognitive awareness throughout the curriculum. Recognizing that they can use different thinking strategies empowers students to deliberately apply the right thinking job for different situations.

### Estimated Play Time

**7-10 minutes**

- Setup and instructions: 1 minute
- Card flipping gameplay (typically 10-15 moves): 5-7 minutes
- End screen and reflection: 1-2 minutes

## In-Class-Game 1C – Messenger Message Decoder

## LESSON 3: Feeling - Our Mind's Messenger

## LESSON LINK & LEARNING OBJECTIVE

**Learning Objective:** Students will learn that feelings are information signals that communicate important data about ourselves and our situations, that feelings manifest both mentally (knowing the feeling) and physically (body sensations), and that different people can have different feelings about the same situation. Students will identify feelings by name, locate them in the body, and distinguish between feelings as information versus instructions.

## GAME FILE NAME: icg-01.03-game01.html

## GAME TITLE: Messenger Message Decoder

## GAME FORMAT: ****Sound & Mood Matching + Interactive Body Heat Map****

This format combines:

- Multi-sensory feeling recognition (audio cues paired with visual scenarios)
- Body mapping where students identify physical locations of emotions
- Pattern recognition across different scenarios showing how feelings provide consistent information
- Interactive heat map visualization showing where feelings "live" in the body

**Why this format:** This is clickable-compatible (students press buttons to match sounds to feelings, select body locations, and identify feeling messages). It's more complex than a simple emotion-matching quiz because it integrates multiple sensory inputs (audio + visual) and requires students to connect abstract feelings to concrete physical sensations. The body mapping component makes invisible feelings tangible and observable, reinforcing psychology as a science that studies measurable phenomena. The multi-modal approach (hearing, seeing, locating) creates deeper engagement and learning.

## LOCATION IN LESSON ARC: Part C of the lesson (approx 20 minutes)

**Replaces:** The existing "MindMaster Game - Messenger Message Decoder"

**Timing:** 10 minutes of gameplay

**Pedagogical Justification:** This placement occurs after students have:

- Learned the five core feeling-messages in Part A (fear=warning, sad=loss, angry=unfair, happy=good, worried=uncertain)
- Watched the "Feelings in My Body" video showing physical manifestation of emotions
- Completed the Body Mapping psychology experiment where they identified where they personally feel emotions

At this point, students understand WHAT feelings communicate and have begun noticing WHERE feelings appear physically. The game provides intensive practice connecting feeling-messages to body sensations through multiple sensory channels. The audio component adds a dimension not available in the psychology experiment, training students to recognize emotional tone in voices-a critical real-world skill. This multi-sensory practice deepens the understanding that feelings are both mental AND physical information signals that can be scientifically observed and decoded.

## PURPOSE

Students develop multi-sensory feeling recognition by matching emotional sounds to body locations and feeling-messages, building an understanding that feelings are physical, information-carrying signals that can be observed and decoded scientifically. The game trains students to recognize that feelings provide consistent, predictable information across different situations and people-reinforcing psychology's core principle that mental processes follow observable patterns.

## SETUP

**Opening Screen:**

- Title: "Messenger Message Decoder"
- Avatar: A friendly cartoon postal messenger character with messenger bag, headphones, and decoder device (gender-neutral, alert and curious expression)
- Visual: Message center setting with sound wave visualizations, body outline diagram, message cards

### MISSION 2: BODY SIGNAL LOCATOR (2.5 minutes)

**Mission Brief:**

- "MISSION 2: Feelings don't just happen in your mind - they appear as PHYSICAL SIGNALS in your body! Let's locate where each feeling lives."
- Body outline appears with 5 zones highlighted and numbered

**Round Format:** Students hear scenarios and identify which body zone(s) they'd feel the emotion in.

**Scenario 1: Before a Performance (15 seconds)**

- Students press 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5
- **MOST COMMON: 3 (STOMACH) or 2 (CHEST)**
- Feedback: "Many people feel NERVOUS in their stomach (butterflies!) or chest (heart racing). Scientists call this the 'stress response' - your body preparing for action!"
- Note: This question accepts multiple "correct" answers since individuals vary

**Scenario 2: Lost Something Important (15 seconds)**

- Text: "Imagine: You lost your favorite stuffed animal. You feel SAD."
- Question: "Where would you feel SAD in your body?"
- Body zones 1-5 shown
- **MOST COMMON: 2 (CHEST) or 1 (HEAD)**

- Question: "Where would EXCITED energy appear?"
- Body zones 1-5 shown
- **MOST COMMON: 2 (CHEST) or 5 (LEGS) or 3 (STOMACH)**
- Feedback: "EXCITED often shows up as energy in your legs (want to jump!), buzzing in stomach, or heart beating fast. That's excitement energy!"

**Scenario 5: Hearing a Strange Noise at Night (15 seconds)**

- Text: "Imagine: You hear a weird noise in the dark. You feel SCARED."
- Question: "Where would SCARED appear?"
- Body zones 1-5 shown
- **MOST COMMON: 3 (STOMACH) or 2 (CHEST) or 1 (HEAD)**
- Feedback: "SCARED often creates stomach dropping, heart pounding, or alert feeling in head. Your body's alarm system activating!"

**Heat Map Reveal:**

- After all 5 scenarios, screen shows: "CLASS HEAT MAP - Where Our Class Feels Emotions!"
- Body diagram displays color intensity showing where most students selected for each feeling

  - \[Performance tier badge\]
- Summary: "You decoded \[X\] feeling messages using sound, body signals, and information analysis!"
- Key learning displayed: "Scientists discovered: Feelings are information messengers that use multiple channels (sounds, body sensations, thoughts) to send important data. Your Messenger system works constantly, giving you useful information about situations!"
- Special note: "Remember: Different people feel things in different places, but the INFORMATION each feeling carries stays consistent. That's how psychology is science - patterns we can observe and study!"
- Button: "Return to Lesson" (links back to lesson-01.03.html)

**Optional Class Discussion Prompt:**

- "Talk with your class: Which feeling was easiest to decode? Which was hardest? Why do you think feelings use BOTH sounds AND body signals to send messages?"

## CONTINUITY NOTE

**Connection to Previous Learning:**

- Builds on Lesson 1's three-part framework by deep-diving into FEELING (Messenger) specifically
- Uses observation skills developed in Lesson 1's "Mind Detective" game, now applied to feelings
- Reinforces Lesson 2's finding that mental processes (thinking) can be studied through effects; here, feelings studied through sounds and body sensations
- Integrates the "information" concept-just as thinking provides information (solutions, plans), feeling provides information (warnings, losses, unfairness)

**Connection to Future Learning:**

- Prepares for Lesson 4's reciprocal loop model by establishing feelings as INPUTS (information) not just automatic reactions
- The body-mapping component foreshadows Lesson 4's discovery that DOING (actions like deep breathing, posture changes) can influence FEELING through feedback loops
- Understanding feelings as information carriers sets up the critical Lesson 4 distinction: feelings are data to notice, not instructions to follow automatically
- The multi-person scenarios (Challenge 2 and 3) introduce how one person's actions affect another's feelings-previewing the social reciprocal loops in Lesson 4

**Avatar Choice:** The messenger character is unique to this lesson, emphasizing feelings as information delivery systems. This avatar will NOT be reused in Lesson 4 (which will use a different avatar), providing visual variety across the unit. However, IF a future unit focuses heavily on emotional communication or empathy, this messenger character could return to create thematic continuity.

**Shared Visual Elements with Other Games:** While avatars differ, the body outline diagram introduced here could potentially appear in Lesson 4's game if that game explores how actions affect body states (e.g., "when you take deep breaths, where does your body feel different?"). This would create useful continuity: same tool (body diagram) used for different purposes (observing feeling locations vs. observing action effects).

## In-Class-Game 1D – Loop Power Discovery Lab

**LESSON 4: Doing - Our Mind's Action Player**

### Lesson Link & Learning Objective

Explain how the three mind parts influence each other in reciprocal loops using specific examples with bidirectional connections. Demonstrate understanding of "loop power" by describing or showing a moment where they used their Action Player to influence their thinking or feeling through the feedback loop.

### Game File Name: icg-01.04-game01.html

### Game Title: ****Loop Power Discovery Lab****

### Game Format: ****Reverse Engineer****

**Format Justification:**  
This format has 0 uses across all units and is uniquely suited to teaching reciprocal loops and "loop power." Unlike forward-cause-and-effect formats, Reverse Engineer requires students to work backward from an observed outcome to identify which prior actions created that result-the essence of understanding loop power. Students see a final mental/emotional state and must trace backward through the feedback loop to discover which Action Player choice created the change in Thinking or Feeling. This backward reasoning reinforces the key lesson concept: that actions aren't just results of thoughts/feelings, but can be deliberately chosen to influence thoughts/feelings through feedback loops. The format makes the abstract concept of bidirectional influence concrete by requiring students to trace the causal chain in reverse.

### Purpose: Students observe final mental or emotional states and work backward to identify which Action Player choices created those outcomes through feedback loops, discovering that they have "loop power" to deliberately influence their thinking and feeling by choosing different actions

### Lesson Arc Location: Part C of Lesson 4 (approximately minutes 30-38 in the 45-minute lesson)

**Pedagogical Rationale:** This game is placed after students have completed the three-round Psychology Experiment demonstrating reciprocal loops (Thinking→Doing, Doing→Feeling, and complete loops) and watched the body language video in Part B. At this point, students have experienced that actions can change feelings and thoughts, but they need practice deliberately identifying and tracing these loops backward. The Reverse Engineer format provides exactly this-by starting with an outcome and working backward, students must actively think about which action created the change, reinforcing their agency and "loop power." This backward-tracing skill is the practical application of reciprocal loop understanding: recognizing that they can choose actions strategically to influence their mental states. The game prepares students for the reflection activity where they'll identify their own loop power moments and consolidates the unit's culminating concept that actions are both controllable and powerful tools for influencing the entire mind system.

### Setup

**Starting Screen:**

- Background: Scientific laboratory setting with three interconnected loop pathways glowing on the wall (showing Thinking ↔ Feeling ↔ Doing with bidirectional arrows)
- Title at top: "Loop Power Discovery Lab"
- Subtitle: "Work backward to discover which action created the change!"
- Center of screen: Large display monitor showing "READY TO INVESTIGATE"
- Three icons representing the mind parts visible on left side:
  - Idea Factory (lightbulb, yellow)
  - Messenger (envelope/signal, blue)
  - Action Player (running figure, green)
- Bottom: "START LAB" button (Button 5 on clicker)
- Visual style: Clean laboratory aesthetic with loop diagrams visible in background

**First Interaction:** Student presses Button 5 (START LAB) to begin. First investigation scenario appears on the display monitor.

### Play (Step-by-Step Sequence)

**Game Structure:**  
Game presents 10 reverse-engineering investigations. Each shows a FINAL STATE (outcome) and students must identify which ACTION created that change by working backward through the loop.

**Investigation Format:**

- **Scenario Presentation:**
  - Display monitor shows final outcome with illustration and text
  - Format: "FINAL STATE: \[Character name\] now feels/thinks \[outcome\]. What ACTION created this change?"
  - Voice narration reads scenario
  - Brief animation shows the final state (e.g., character smiling, standing tall, looking confident)
- **The Backward Trace Challenge:**
  - Three action options appear (clicker buttons 1-3)
  - Each option represents a different Action Player choice that might have preceded the outcome
  - Student must select which action created the final state through a feedback loop
  - Timer (optional): 15 seconds to choose (gentle, non-stressful)
- **Answer Feedback:**

**If CORRECT:**

- - Loop diagram animates on screen showing the bidirectional path:
        - ACTION → influenced → FEELING/THINKING → created feedback → NEW OUTCOME
    - Feedback text: "Correct! Working backward: \[Character\] DID \[action\], which changed \[their feeling/thinking\], creating loop power!"
      - Example: "Correct! Working backward: Maya DID smile and wave, which made her FEEL friendly, which made her THINK 'I'm brave,' creating loop power!"
    - Character gives thumbs up
    - +10 points awarded
    - "LOOP DISCOVERED!" badge briefly appears

**If INCORRECT:**

- - Screen shows gentle shake
    - Feedback: "Not quite. That action wouldn't create this outcome. Think: what did \[character\] DO with their body that could change how they felt or thought?"
    - Second attempt available: remaining two options shown
    - If correct on second try: +5 points, loop diagram shown with explanation
    - If incorrect again: Correct answer revealed with loop explanation, 0 points

- **Next Investigation:**
  - After feedback (4 seconds), next scenario appears
  - Progress shown: "Investigation \[X\] of 10"

- "You traced \[X\] loops correctly on the first try!"
- Animated loop diagram showing all three mind parts with bidirectional arrows
- Key insight text box: "Remember: You can't always control thoughts and feelings appearing, BUT you CAN control your actions-and your actions create feedback that influences your thoughts and feelings. That's your LOOP POWER!"

**Reflection Challenge:**

- Text: "Think about TODAY in this class. Can you remember a time when YOU used loop power?"
- Prompt: "What did your Action Player DO that changed how you felt or thought?"
- Input: Four example options (clicker buttons 1-4):
  - I smiled and it made me feel happier
  - I sat up tall and felt more confident
  - I tried something and felt proud
  - I took a breath and felt calmer
- All answers accepted as valid with response: "Yes! That's YOUR loop power working! You used your Action Player to influence your whole mind!"

**Exit:**

- Button 5: "RETURN TO LESSON" (links back to lesson-01.04.html)

**Class Summary (Teacher View):**

- Average score and zone distribution
- Most challenging investigation (highest error rate)
- Percentage scoring 80+ (Loop Power Expert level)
- Distribution of reflection responses (which loop power strategy students recalled using)

### Continuity Note

**Link to Prior Learning:**  
This game integrates all three mind parts from Lessons 1-3 (Thinking/Idea Factory, Feeling/Messenger, Doing/Action Player) and demonstrates the reciprocal loop model introduced throughout Lesson 4. Students apply their understanding that the three parts influence each other bidirectionally, with special focus on how actions create feedback.

**Link to Future Learning:**  
Understanding loop power-that controllable actions can influence thoughts and feelings-is foundational for all future units. This concept will support learning about attention strategies (Unit 2), memory techniques (Unit 3), emotion understanding (Unit 4), relationship skills (Unit 5-6), and problem-solving (Unit 7-10). The ability to trace loops backward develops metacognitive awareness and empowers students to recognize their agency within the mind system throughout the curriculum.
