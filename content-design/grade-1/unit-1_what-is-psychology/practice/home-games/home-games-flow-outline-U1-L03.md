## Home Game 3A – Feelings Sound Match

> Jump to: [Setup](#setup) · [Play](#play) · [Scoring](#scoring) · [Win Condition](#win-condition) · [Continuity Note](#continuity-note)

### Learning Objective

Identify at least four different feelings by name and describe what information each one communicates. Recognize that the same situation can create different feelings in different people.

### Game Purpose

Develop multi-sensory emotion recognition by connecting auditory emotional cues (tone of voice, sounds) with visual representations (faces, body language) and emotion labels, reinforcing that feelings communicate specific information.

### Game File Name & Format

`hg-01.03-01.html` — Match Sound to Image (Audio-Visual Matching)

### Estimated Play Time

7-9 minutes

### Setup

Opening screen shows "Feelings Sound Match" title with sound wave icon and heart symbol.

Avatar guide (friendly character named "Echo" - animated sound wave with a face) says: "Feelings don't just show on faces - you can hear them too! Listen carefully to each sound, then match it to the right feeling."

Game board displays:

* Audio player button (big speaker icon) at center-top
* 6 feeling cards arranged in two rows below:

  * Row 1: Happy, Sad, Angry
  * Row 2: Scared, Excited, Worried
* Each card shows cartoon face with that expression + feeling label
* Progress tracker: "Round 1 of 4" and "Matches: 0/6"

### Play

#### Round 1: Voice Tones (6 matches)

Audio plays: Voice saying "I can't believe it!" in different emotional tones

* Match 1: Excited tone → Match to "Excited" card
* Match 2: Angry tone → Match to "Angry" card
* Continue for all 6 feelings

**Play sequence for each match:**

* Speaker button glows and plays audio automatically
* Player can replay up to 3 times by tapping speaker
* Player taps one of the 6 feeling cards
* If correct: Card glows gold, ding sound, "Yes! That voice sounds [feeling]! The Messenger is telling you: [message]"

  * Example: "Yes! That voice sounds EXCITED! The Messenger is telling you: Something good is happening!"
* If incorrect: Card shakes, gentle buzz, "Hmm, listen again. How does that voice really sound?"
* When correct, card stays lit and audio moves to next feeling

#### Round 2: Situation Sounds (6 matches)

Sounds from situations that create feelings:

* Thunder crash → Scared ("Warning! Possible danger!")
* Birthday song → Happy ("Something good is happening!")
* Glass breaking → Worried ("I'm not sure what will happen next")
* Door slamming → Angry ("Something feels unfair or is blocking me!")
* Gentle crying → Sad ("Something important is hurt or gone")
* Crowd cheering → Excited ("Something good is happening!")

#### Round 3: Mixed Audio (6 matches - higher difficulty)

Combination of voice + situation sound + music

* Example: Giggling + playground sounds + upbeat music → Happy
* Example: Gasp + spooky music + wind → Scared

#### Round 4: Tricky Scenarios (3 matches)

Same situation creates different feelings in different people (reinforces lesson objective)

Scenario audio: "You hear: Tomorrow we're going to a new place we've never been!"

* Two correct answers:

  * Child Voice 1: Excited tone → Excited card
  * Child Voice 2: Nervous tone → Worried card

Echo says: "Great listening! The same situation made one person excited and another person worried. Everyone's Messenger works for them!"

### Scoring

* Correct match on first listen: 50 points
* Correct match on second listen: 30 points
* Correct match on third listen: 15 points
* Completing a round perfectly (all 6 first-listen matches): +100 bonus

* **Maximum:** 1,050 points

### Special Feature: "Feelings Library"

Round 4 directly addresses lesson objective that same situations create different feelings. Prepares for Lesson 4 by establishing that feelings influence observable actions (voice tone is an action).

## Home Game 3B – Body Map Explorer

> Jump to: [Setup](#setup-1) · [Play](#play-1) · [Scoring](#scoring-1) · [Win Condition](#win-condition-1) · [Continuity Note](#continuity-note-1)

### Learning Objective

Locate where specific feelings appear in their body (pointing to stomach for nervous, chest for excited, or shoulders for worried). Explain how feelings connect to thinking and doing in a specific scenario.

### Game Purpose

Demonstrate that feelings are physical experiences with observable body locations, reinforcing that the Messenger communicates through both mind and body. Build connection between body sensations (feeling), thoughts (thinking), and visible actions (doing).

### Game File Name & Format

`hg-01.03-02.html` — Interactive Diagrams (Tap-to-Discover Body Mapping)

### Estimated Play Time

9-10 minutes total

* Phase 1 (Discovery): 3-4 minutes
* Phase 2 (Scenarios): 5-6 minutes
* Phase 3 (Exploration): Optional, 1-2 minutes

### Setup

Opening screen shows "Body Map Explorer" title with glowing human outline.

Avatar guide (friendly character named "Dr. Soma" - cartoon doctor with stethoscope) says: "Your Messenger doesn't just work in your mind - it sends signals all through your body! Let's discover where different feelings live."

Main display shows:

* Large cartoon child avatar (gender-neutral, friendly) in center
* Body parts are subtly glowing zones: head, chest, stomach, shoulders, arms, legs
* Feeling selector at top: 6 emotion buttons (Happy, Scared, Angry, Sad, Excited, Worried)

### Continuity Note

Directly addresses Lesson 3's objective about locating feelings in the body. Extends learning by explicitly connecting body sensations (Messenger) to thoughts (Idea Factory) and visible actions (Action Player), integrating all three mind parts.

Prepares for Lesson 4's focus on control by repeatedly showing that body feelings appear automatically (can't control) but actions are chooseable (can control). The "Same Situation, Different Feelings" scenario reinforces individual differences and empathy.

Builds on Lesson 1's framework (three parts) and Lesson 2's thinking jobs (thoughts in scenarios) while deepening Lesson 3's feeling concepts.

## How Lesson 3 Fits into the Full Learning Arc

Lesson 3 explores **Feeling – the Messenger**, deepening students’ understanding of emotions as sources of information rather than impulses. The two home games build auditory and physical awareness of feelings, helping learners recognize that emotions are signals with meanings.

* **Lesson 1:** Introduced the three-part framework (Thinking–Feeling–Doing).
* **Lesson 2:** Focused on *Thinking (Idea Factory)* and mental processes.
* **Lesson 3 (this document):** Develops *Feeling (Messenger)* through sound and body mapping, emphasizing emotional literacy and empathy.
* **Lesson 4:** Will connect feelings to *Doing (Action Player)*, teaching control and action choice.

> 🧠 **Learning Arc Summary:** Awareness → Understanding → Regulation → Agency.
> This arc underpins MindMaster’s psychology literacy model: knowledge → self-efficacy → mental resilience.
