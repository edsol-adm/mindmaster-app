## Home Game 1A – Mind Parts Detective

### Lesson Link & Learning Objective {#lesson-link--learning-objective-1a}
**Unit 1, Lesson 1: How Our Minds Work**  
Learning Objective: Identify the three parts of the mind—Thinking, Feeling, and Doing—and give one example of each from daily life. Recognize which part of the mind is active in common scenarios.

### Game File Name {#game-file-name-1a}
`hg-01.01-01.html`

### Game Format {#game-format-1a}
Scene Explorer (Hidden Object)

### Purpose {#purpose-1a}
Reinforce recognition of the three mind parts (Thinking, Feeling, Doing) by observing animated characters in everyday scenarios and identifying which part is actively working in each moment.

### Setup {#setup-1a}
Opening screen shows a colourful playground scene with six cartoon children engaged in different activities.  
Title: *"Mind Parts Detective – Can you find all three mind parts at work?"*  
A friendly avatar guide introduces the task and the three badge slots appear: Idea Factory (lightbulb icon), Messenger (heart icon), Action Player (running figure icon).

### Play {#play-1a}
- Round 1: Playground Scene with 6 children, each showing a different mind part at work.  
  - Tap → Zoom animation → Choice or auto-identification depending on scenario.  
  - Correct answers trigger star collection and badge glow.
- Round 2: Classroom Scene (unlocked after Round 1) with more complex scenarios.
- Round 3: Home Scene (unlocked after Round 2) with mixed scenarios.

### Scoring {#scoring-1a}
- 1 star per correctly identified mind part  
- Bonus stars for collecting all three badge types per round  
- Maximum: 27 stars  
- Progress bar tracks badge collection

### Win Condition {#win-condition-1a}
Complete all 3 scenes with at least 15 correct identifications (83% accuracy) to unlock the “Master Mind Detective” badge.

### Continuity Note {#continuity-note-1a}
This game reinforces Lesson 1’s core framework. It prepares for Lessons 2–4 by establishing pattern recognition of the three parts, which will be explored individually in subsequent lessons.

### Estimated Play Time {#estimated-play-time-1a}
7–9 minutes

## Home Game 1B – Mind Chain Reaction

### Lesson Link & Learning Objective {#lesson-link--learning-objective-1b}
**Unit 1, Lesson 1: How Our Minds Work**  
Learning Objective: Explain how the three parts work together in a specific situation. Describe the three parts of the mind at work in another person during an observed activity.

### Game File Name {#game-file-name-1b}
`hg-01.01-02.html`

### Game Format {#game-format-1b}
Cause & Effect Chains (Sequence Builder with Animation)

### Purpose {#purpose-1b}
Demonstrate how the three mind parts work together as a connected system by building cause-and-effect chains and observing the sequential flow from internal processes to observable actions.

### Setup {#setup-1b}
Opening screen shows animated gears representing the three mind parts.  
Friendly avatar (Linky) introduces the task: *"Let's build mind chains! Put the parts in the right order to see what happens."*

### Play {#play-1b}
- **Level 1:** Simple 3-part chains (5 scenarios).  
- **Level 2:** 4-part chains (3 scenarios).  
- **Level 3:** Multiple pathways showing how different thoughts and feelings can lead to different actions.  
- Players drag and drop cards into the correct sequence.  
- Correct order triggers animated flow (Idea Factory → Messenger → Action Player).

### Scoring {#scoring-1b}
- 3 stars for correct sequencing on first try  
- 2 stars on second try  
- 1 star on third try  
- Bonus: 5 stars for completing Level 3  
- Maximum: 50 stars

### Win Condition {#win-condition-1b}
Complete all 10 scenarios with at least 25 stars to unlock the “Chain Master” badge.

### Continuity Note {#continuity-note-1b}
Builds directly on Lesson 1’s concept of the three interconnected parts. Prepares for later lessons by showing how each part influences the others, which will be explored in more depth individually.

### Estimated Play Time {#estimated-play-time-1b}
8–10 minutes

## How Lesson 1 Fits into the Full Learning Arc

Lesson 1 lays the **foundation of the Thinking–Feeling–Doing framework**. The two home games are intentionally designed to introduce learners to the three mind parts through observation and pattern recognition.

- **Lesson 1 (this document):** Introduces the three-part framework through observation and simple sequencing.  
- **Lesson 2:** Deepens understanding of *Thinking* (Idea Factory) through categorisation and problem-solving.  
- **Lesson 3:** Explores *Feeling* (Messenger) as information, building emotional literacy and empathy.  
- **Lesson 4:** Focuses on *Doing* (Action Player) and agency, guiding learners to pause and choose actions.

> 🧠 **Learning Arc Summary:** Awareness → Understanding → Application → Agency.  
> This arc is central to MindMaster’s psychology literacy model and builds the foundation for measurable resilience outcomes.
