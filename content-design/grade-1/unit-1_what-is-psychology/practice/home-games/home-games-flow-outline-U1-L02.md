> Jump to: [Setup](#setup) ¬∑ [Play](#play) ¬∑ [Scoring](#scoring) ¬∑ [Win Condition](#win-condition) ¬∑ [Continuity Note](#continuity-note)

### Learning Objective
Learning Objective Recognize that thinking includes remembering and demonstrate how organizing information helps memory work better.

### Game Purpose
Game Purpose Exercise the Idea Factory's remembering function through active pattern repetition, demonstrating that memory can be strengthened with practice and strategy.

### Game File Name & Format
Game File Name: hg-01.02-01.html

Game Format: Simon Says / Repeat the Pattern (Memory Sequence Game) Progressive memory challenge where players must remember and repeat increasingly complex sequences, demonstrating how the Idea Factory's remembering function works.

### Estimated Play Time
Estimated Play Time: 6-8 minutes

### Setup
Setup Opening screen shows title "Memory Master Challenge" with a glowing brain icon surrounded by colorful gems.

Avatar guide (wise owl character named "Professor Hoot") says: "Your Idea Factory is amazing at remembering! Let's see how many patterns you can recall. Watch carefully, then repeat what you saw!"

Game board displays 6 colored gem buttons arranged in a circle: red, blue, green, yellow, purple, orange.

Progress display shows: Level 1, Pattern Length: 3

### Play
Play

**Phase 1: Watch**
- Gems light up in sequence with musical notes (each color has unique tone) 
- Example Level 1: Red ‚Üí Blue ‚Üí Yellow (3-step sequence) 
- Each gem glows for 0.8 seconds with a pause between 
- After sequence ends, gems return to normal 
- Text appears: "Now it's your turn! Tap the gems in the same order." 

**Phase 2: Recall**
- Player taps gems to repeat the sequence 
- Each tap plays the corresponding tone 
- If correct sequence: All gems flash with celebration animation, "Great remembering!" message 
- If incorrect: Gentle error sound, "Try watching again!" and sequence replays once 

**Progression:**
- Level 1-3: Sequences of 3 gems (warm-up) 
- Level 4-6: Sequences of 4 gems 
- Level 7-9: Sequences of 5 gems 
- Level 10-12: Sequences of 6 gems 
- Level 13-15: Sequences of 7 gems (expert level) 

**Special Challenge Rounds (appear every 5 levels):**
- "Slow-Fast Challenge": Sequence plays twice - first slowly, then at normal speed 
- "Rhythm Pattern": Some gems repeat (Red-Red-Blue-Red), teaching chunking 
- "Color Family": Sequences use similar colors (red-orange-yellow), requiring closer attention 

**Memory Strategy Tips (appear between levels):**
- Professor Hoot offers hints: 
  - "Try saying the colors out loud as you watch!" 
  - "Look for patterns - do any colors repeat?" 
  - "Break long sequences into chunks of 2 or 3." 
  - "Create a story: Red-Blue-Green could be 'apple, sky, grass'!" 

### Scoring
Scoring
- Base: 10 points per correct sequence on first try 
- Bonus multipliers: 
  - 3-gem sequence: √ó1 
  - 4-gem sequence: √ó1.5 
  - 5-gem sequence: √ó2 
  - 6-gem sequence: √ó2.5 
  - 7-gem sequence: √ó3

- Maximum possible: 1,000 points 

### Win Condition
Win Condition Reach Level 10 (complete 10 sequences successfully). Unlock "Memory Master" badge showing brain with glowing connections. Optionally continue to Level 15 for "Memory Champion" badge.

### Continuity Note
Continuity Note Directly practices the REMEMBERING function introduced in Lesson 2. The strategy tips reinforce the lesson's teaching that organization helps memory. Prepares for later lessons by demonstrating that mental skills can be exercised and improved.

### Learning Objective
Learning Objective Identify the five thinking jobs (remembering, imagining, planning, problem-solving, deciding) in everyday scenarios and recognize which job to use in different situations.

### Game Purpose
Game Purpose Develop ability to recognize and distinguish between the five thinking jobs by carefully observing characters in everyday situations and analyzing which Idea Factory function they're using.

### Game File Name & Format
Game File Name: hg-01.02-02.html

Game Format: Observation Challenge (Video Scenario Analysis) Watch short animated scenarios and identify which of the five thinking jobs is being used by observing character behavior and context clues.

### Estimated Play Time
Estimated Play Time: 8-10 minutes

### Setup
Setup Opening screen shows "Thinking Jobs Detective" title with magnifying glass over a brain icon.

Avatar guide (detective character named "Inspector Think") says: "Every time your Idea Factory works, it uses a special job! Watch these kids carefully and tell me which thinking job you spot."

## How Lesson 2 Fits into the Full Learning Arc

Lesson 2 strengthens the learner‚Äôs understanding of the **Idea Factory**, the thinking part of the mind. The two home games provide first-hand experience of how the mind remembers, organizes, and uses different ‚Äúthinking jobs‚Äù to make sense of the world.

- **Lesson 1:** Introduced the three-part framework (Thinking‚ÄìFeeling‚ÄìDoing) through observation and simple sequencing.  
- **Lesson 2 (this document):** Focuses on *Thinking* ‚Äî exploring how the Idea Factory remembers, imagines, plans, solves problems, and decides.  
- **Lesson 3:** Shifts to *Feeling* (Messenger), helping learners recognise emotions as important mental signals.  
- **Lesson 4:** Moves to *Doing* (Action Player), guiding learners to connect thought, feeling, and action with self-control and intention.

> üß† **Learning Arc Summary:** Awareness ‚Üí Understanding ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Agency.  
> This arc is central to MindMaster‚Äôs psychology literacy model and builds the foundation for measurable resilience outcomes.
