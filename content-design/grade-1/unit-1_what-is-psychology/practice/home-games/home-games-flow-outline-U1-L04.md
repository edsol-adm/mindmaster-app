### Lesson Objective
Explain how thinking and feeling each guide actions using specific examples. Distinguish between actions they can control and thoughts or feelings they cannot control.

### Game Purpose
Demonstrate that actions result from either thinking or feeling (or both), and that while thoughts and feelings appear automatically, the Action Player's choices are controllable. Build understanding of agency and self-regulation.

### Game File Name & Format
`hg-01.04-01.html` — Sequence Builder (Multi-Path Construction)

### Estimated Play Time
10-12 minutes total  
Tutorial: 1-2 minutes  
Level 1 (4 builds): 3-4 minutes  
Level 2 (3 builds): 3-4 minutes  
Level 3 (2 builds): 2-3 minutes  
Celebration & Path Lab intro: 1 minute

### Setup
Opening screen shows "Action Path Builder" title with three connected gears labeled Think, Feel, Do.  
Avatar guide (builder character named "Constructo" wearing hard hat and tool belt) says: "Let's build action paths! You'll see how your Idea Factory and Messenger both guide your Action Player - and discover what you can control!"  
Game board shows:
- Three vertical lanes labeled: THINKING → FEELING → DOING
- Card deck at bottom with draggable cards
- Blueprint area showing empty path slots
- Control meter at top right showing "Can Control" vs "Automatic" for each part
- Score display: "Paths Built: 0 | Points: 0"

### Play

#### Tutorial Level: Learning the Basics
Constructo explains: "Watch! Here's how an action path works:"

Demonstration Path (auto-builds):
- Situation card appears: "You see a toy on the shelf"
- THINKING card slides in: "I want that toy"
- Arrow connects to FEELING card: "I feel excited"
- Arrow connects to DOING card: "I reach for the toy"
- Path lights up with glowing connections
- Control meter animates showing:
  - THINKING: "Automatic" (red) - thoughts pop up on their own
  - FEELING: "Automatic" (red) - feelings appear automatically
  - DOING: "Controllable ✓" (green) - YOU choose what to do

Constructo: "See? Thoughts and feelings pop up automatically - you can't stop them! But YOU control what your Action Player does! That's your power. Let's practice building paths!"

Practice Round:
- Situation: "You drop your ice cream"
- Simple card choices provided:
  - THINKING: "Oh no!" / "I can get more"
  - FEELING: "Feel sad" / "Feel upset"
  - DOING: "Cry" / "Ask for another" / "Clean it up"

Player drags cards into slots → Path lights up → Constructo: "Great! You just built your first action path! Notice: you chose what the Action Player did, even though the thought and feeling happened automatically. Let's build more!"

---

#### Level 1: Direct Paths (4 Builds)

##### Build 1: "The Broken Pencil"
Situation card appears: "Your pencil breaks while you're drawing"

Available Cards:

THINKING options (choose 1):  
A) "I could use a pen instead"  
B) "I'll ask the teacher for help"  
C) "I'll sharpen a new pencil"  
D) "This always happens to me"

FEELING options (choose 1):  
A) "Feel frustrated"  
B) "Feel annoyed"  
C) "Stay calm"  
D) "Feel determined"

DOING options (choose 1):  
A) "Get a pen from the supply box"  
B) "Walk to teacher and ask for help"  
C) "Go sharpen a pencil"  
D) "Give up and stop drawing"  
E) "Throw the pencil"

Play Sequence:
- Player drags THINKING card to first slot
- Player drags FEELING card to second slot
- Player drags DOING card to third slot
- Path connects with arrows
- Animation plays showing the sequence

Example Valid Path A:
Think: "I could use a pen" → Feel: "stay calm" → Do: "get a pen"  
Animation shows: Character has calm thought bubble, neutral face, walks to supply box, gets pen, continues drawing  
Constructo: "Excellent path! Your Idea Factory thought of a solution, your Messenger stayed calm, and your Action Player made a good choice."  
Points: +150

Example Valid Path B:
Think: "I'll ask for help" → Feel: "feel frustrated" → Do: "walk to teacher and ask"  
Animation shows: Character has frustrated face, approaches teacher calmly, asks politely  
Constructo: "Great! Notice something important: you felt frustrated (automatic!), but your Action Player STILL chose to ask politely instead of giving up or throwing things. You controlled your action even with a frustrated feeling!"  
Points: +150 + 50 bonus for showing control with difficult feeling = +200

Less Optimal Path:
Think: "This always happens" → Feel: "frustrated" → Do: "give up"  
Constructo: "Hmm, that thought and feeling led to giving up. Let's try rebuilding this path with a more helpful thought. Remember: you can't control the first thought that pops up, but your Idea Factory can think of different ideas!"  
Points: +50 (path completed but suboptimal)  
Replay option offered with hint

Control Meter Update:
THINKING: "Automatic but can shift" (yellow)  
FEELING: "Automatic" (red)

- "Push them out of line"
- "Stay quiet but feel upset"
- "Let them stay, don't say anything"

Example Strong Path:
Think: "That's not fair!" → Feel: "angry" → Do: "tell them nicely to wait"  
Animation shows: Character's face shows anger (red cheeks), but mouth says calm words, other child apologizes and moves back  
Constructo: "WOW! This is super impressive! Your Messenger sent ANGER automatically - you saw unfairness. But your Action Player PAUSED and chose calm words instead of pushing. That's advanced control! Scientists call this 'self-regulation' - you're doing it!"  
Points: +200 + 100 bonus for strong self-regulation = +300

Teaching Moment (if push chosen):
Constructo: "Your angry feeling wanted your Action Player to push right away. That's a normal urge! But here's your power: you can PAUSE between feeling and doing. Let's try this path again - what could your Action Player choose instead of pushing?"  
Replay with hint: Green glow on "tell them nicely" option  
Points: +50 on retry

Progress Update: "Paths Built: 2/9"

Path B: Think "ask for help" → Feel "frustrated" → Do "ask grown-up" (+200)  
Path C: Think "I'll never get it" → Feel "defeated" → Do "give up" (+100)

Constructo: "See how different thoughts lead to different actions? Your Idea Factory's problem-solving job can find solutions! And notice: you can't force yourself to feel determined, but you CAN control whether your Action Player tries or gives up."

THINKING: "Tried to understand the feeling" (yellow)  
DOING: "YOU chose what to do! ✓" (green)

Constructo: "This is so important! Sometimes feelings happen SUPER FAST, before thinking. That's normal and okay! Your Action Player still gets to choose what to do."

### Continuity Note
Integrates all learning from Lessons 1–3 while focusing on Lesson 4's core teaching:

- Lesson 1: Three-part framework (Thinking, Feeling, Doing)  
- Lesson 2: Idea Factory jobs  
- Lesson 3: Messenger's automatic signals  
- Lesson 4 Core: Thoughts and feelings guide actions, but only actions are controllable.

The branching paths demonstrate cause-and-effect thinking and show children their choices matter. The "Path Lab" extends learning through experimentation. This game delivers the unit's ultimate message: Understanding how your mind works gives you power and agency. You can't always control your thoughts and feelings, but you CAN control your Action Player - and that's your superpower.

## CHAPTER 2: The Playground Problem (Different Scenario)

### SCENE 1: The Knocked-Over Tower (Main Choice Point)
Animation: YOU are building a tall tower of blocks. Suddenly, another child runs by and accidentally knocks your tower down! Blocks scatter everywhere.  

**Sensations appear on screen:**
- Your Messenger instantly sends ANGRY feelings (shown with red glow around heart icon)  
- Your body gets hot and tense (animation shows character's face reddening, fists clenching)  
- Your Idea Factory thinks: "That's not fair! I worked hard on that!"  

**Narration:** "Your tower crashes down! Your Messenger sends angry feelings automatically – you can't stop it! Your body feels hot. Your hands want to push. This is a big test for your Action Player!"  

**Urge Indicator PULSES STRONGLY:** "STRONG URGE: Push them or yell!"  

**PAUSE Prompt appears LARGE:** "⏸️⏸️⏸️ BIG PAUSE NEEDED! Your Messenger sent strong anger. Your body has urges. But your Action Player can still CHOOSE. Take three breaths."  

If player clicks pause 3 times, Pause Power Meter fills significantly and Pacer says: "Excellent breathing! You're using your most important power – the pause between feeling and doing!"

##### OUTCOME A: (Push and yell)
Animation: Your character pushes the other child. They fall and look shocked and hurt. They start crying. Teacher sees and comes over looking serious.  

**Consequence Scene:**
- Other child is hurt and upset  
- Teacher talks to both of you  
- You both have to sit out of recess  
- Other child doesn't want to play with you anymore  
- You feel bad afterward – anger went away but now feel guilty  

**Narration:** "Your angry feeling was so strong that your Action Player acted on the urge without pausing. The anger was automatic – you couldn't help feeling it. But the pushing? That was your Action Player's choice. When we act on angry urges without pausing, problems get bigger."  

**Pacer appears thoughtfully:** "Strong feelings create strong urges! That's normal. But here's the really important thing: You CAN'T control feeling angry (it's automatic), but you CAN control whether you push or not (that's your Action Player's power). Want to see what could have happened with a pause?"  

**Result Display:**
- Friendship: Damaged 💔  
- Consequence: Time-out ⏱️  
- Other child's trust: Lost 📉  
- Your feeling afterward: Guilty and sad 😞

##### OUTCOME B: (Pause, breathe, calm words)
Animation: Your character's face shows anger, but then you see them breathe (chest rising and falling 3 times). Face stays a bit red, but you speak calmly: "That was an accident. Please be more careful next time." Other child says: "Oh! I'm so sorry! I didn't see it. Want me to help rebuild?"  

**Rebuilding Scene:**
- Both children rebuild together  
- Other child is extra careful  
- Tower gets built even taller  
- Both smile  
- Teacher notices and gives thumbs up  

**Narration:** "This is AMAZING self-regulation! Your Messenger sent strong angry feelings (automatic – couldn't stop that). Your body wanted to push (automatic urge – couldn't stop that either). BUT – you paused! Your Idea Factory had time to think. Your Action Player chose calm words instead of pushing. You controlled what you could control!"  

**Pacer appears with pride:** "This is what scientists call 'self-regulation' – and you just did it PERFECTLY! You felt the automatic anger, noticed the urge to push, PAUSED, and chose differently. That's the most powerful skill humans have!"  

**Special Teaching Moment:** Screen shows comparison:
- Left side: "What You COULDN'T Control" – Angry feeling appearing (automatic), Urge to push (automatic), Red face/hot feeling (automatic)  
- Right side: "What You COULD Control" – Pausing (your choice!), Breathing (your choice!), Using calm words (your choice!), Not pushing (your choice!)  

**Result Display:**

Animation: You're at after-school program. There's a really cool toy/game – maybe a tablet with a fun game, or special art supplies, or a popular ball. You and another child (Sam) both want it at the same time. You reach for it simultaneously.  

**Narration:** "You both want the same thing! Your Messenger sends a mix of feelings – excitement about the toy, but also frustration that someone else wants it too. Your Idea Factory thinks: 'I really want that!' and 'But they want it too...' and 'What should I do?'"

## How Lesson 4 Fits into the Full Learning Arc

Lesson 4 completes the Thinking–Feeling–Doing framework by focusing on the Action Player — the part of the mind that turns internal processes into observable behaviour. After learners have explored Thinking (Idea Factory) and Feeling (Messenger) in Lessons 2 and 3, this lesson shifts the focus to Doing — the gateway from internal to external action.

Lesson 1: Introduced the three-part model — Thinking, Feeling, Doing — as the foundational map of how minds work.  
Lesson 2: Deepened understanding of Thinking through problem-solving and categorisation, showing how the Idea Factory generates options.  
Lesson 3: Explored Feeling as information, helping learners observe emotions as natural signals rather than commands.  
Lesson 4 (this document): Synthesises both insights by showing that while thoughts and feelings appear automatically, actions are controllable. It teaches that our real power lies in pausing between feeling and doing, a key concept in self-regulation and agency.

🧠 **Learning Arc Summary:** Awareness → Understanding → Application → Agency  

Through this final lesson, students move from understanding how the mind works to realising “I can control what I do.” This recognition of controllable versus automatic processes transforms knowledge into self-efficacy — the belief that one can act effectively despite inner challenges. It closes the unit’s psychology-literacy arc by reinforcing that knowledge of the mind leads to empowerment and resilience, not through emotional management, but through scientific understanding of mental processes.
