# Grade 1 · Unit 1 — What Is Psychology?

**Purpose**  
This foundational unit introduces students to the **mind as an interconnected system** with three essential parts:  
**Thinking** (the “Idea Factory” for planning, problem-solving, and imagining),  
**Feeling** (the “Messenger” providing information through emotions and body sensations), and  
**Doing** (the “Action Player” making our inner world visible through observable actions).  

Through daily-life examples, sorting activities, and observation exercises, children learn to **identify and label** these three parts in themselves and others. They practise distinguishing between **private mental experiences** (thinking and feeling = inside) and **observable actions** (doing = outside).  
This three-part model establishes psychology’s foundational framework — that mental processes can be observed, categorised, and understood systematically — providing the organising structure for all future psychology concepts.

**Theory of Change**  
Knowledge → Self-efficacy (“I can do this”) → Mental resilience (“I can handle tricky situations better”).

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this unit, students will be able to:

1. **Define** psychology as the study of how minds work and **explain** that everyone has a mind with three parts — Thinking, Feeling, and Doing.  
2. **Identify and label** examples of each part in everyday scenarios from their own lives or observations of others.  
3. **Distinguish** between private mental experiences (thinking and feeling) and observable actions (doing) by categorising examples as “inside my mind” or “others can see.”  
4. **Describe** how the three parts of the mind work together using simple cause-and-effect language (e.g., “I thought about…, then I felt…, so I did…”).  
5. **Use** the framework vocabulary (Idea Factory, Messenger, Action Player) to discuss mental experiences and explain actions in themselves and others.

## Lesson Sequence
1. **L01 — How Our Minds Work**    
   Psychology as the study of how minds work; identifying Thinking, Feeling, and Doing.  
2. **L02 — Thinking · Our Mind’s Idea Factory**    
   The many jobs of thinking — remembering, imagining, planning, problem-solving, deciding.  
3. **L03 — Feeling · Our Mind’s Messenger**    
   Feelings as information signals in mind and body; interpreting emotional messages.  
4. **L04 — Doing · Our Mind’s Action Player**    
   Actions as visible evidence of the mind; how thinking and feeling guide behaviour; self-control.

## Digital & Interactive Components (MindMaster)
- **MindMaster Experiments & Games** – Interactive sorting, matching, and quiz activities reinforcing each lesson.  
- **At-Home Reflections** – Short adaptive games prompting children to observe their own minds scientifically.  
- **Teacher Dashboard** – Shows class participation and lesson-specific averages for pilot monitoring.

## Connection to Curriculum Arc
Unit 1 provides the organising framework for understanding all later topics — attention, memory, imagination, emotion, relationships, and problem-solving.  
By framing the mind as an understandable system rather than a mystery, students gain early **psychological literacy** and self-efficacy (“I can understand how my mind works”), creating the foundation for resilience and empathy throughout the six-year programme.
