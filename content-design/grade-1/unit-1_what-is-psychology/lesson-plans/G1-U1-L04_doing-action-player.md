## Lesson Objective
Students learn that **actions (doing)** are the only part of the mind others can directly observe, and that **thinking** and **feeling** both guide actions in different ways.  
They identify types of observable actions, explain how the three mind parts work together to produce behaviour, and distinguish between experiences they **can’t** control (thoughts / feelings) versus actions they **can** control:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

## Warm-Up (5 min) – *“Invisible vs Visible Challenge”*

**Steps**
1. Call two students to the front.  
   - Student A: “Think about your favourite animal, but don’t say or do anything.” (class cannot guess)  
   - Student B: “Think about your favourite animal **and act it out.**” (class guesses easily)  
2. Ask: “Why could we guess B but not A?”  
3. Conclude: “Thinking and feeling happen inside where we can’t see them. **Doing** is visible! Today we’ll study how our Action Player makes the invisible mind visible to the world.”

## Explore + Practice (30 min total)

### Part A – *The Many Types of Doing* (8 min)

**Activity – “Action Player Catalogue”**
1. Explain: “Your Action Player isn’t only big movements — it includes *all observable actions!*”  
2. Identify five types of doing:  
   - **Speaking** – talking, laughing, singing, asking.  
   - **Body Movements** – walking, reaching, jumping, sitting still.  
   - **Facial Expressions** – smiling, frowning, eyes wide.  
   - **Gestures** – waving, pointing, crossing arms, nodding.  
   - **Choosing to Wait** – pausing or staying still on purpose.  
3. **Quick Demo:** Teacher models each; students copy.  
4. Reinforce: “Even choosing not to do something is a kind of doing — your Action Player is working!”  

**Materials:** “Types of Doing” chart:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

### Part B – *Psychology Experiment – The Simon Says Control Test* (8 min)

Demonstrates how **thinking can control doing**, even when feelings create strong urges.

**Steps**
1. Students stand; explain: “Classic *Simon Says* — but we’re observing our minds scientifically.”  
2. **Round 1 – Normal play:** Follow only when “Simon Says.”  
3. **Observation Break:** Ask “What happened when I said ‘jump’ without ‘Simon Says’?”  
   - *Messenger* felt urge to jump.  
   - *Idea Factory* thought “wait, no Simon Says.”  
   - *Action Player* stayed still → thinking in control.  
4. **Round 2 – Faster:** more mistakes.  
5. Discuss: “When we go too fast, feelings guide actions more than thinking does.”  
6. Debrief: “You can’t control feelings appearing, but you *can* control what your Action Player does about them — that’s your power!”  

**Materials:** none (active game):contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

### Psychology Video (2 min)

**Title:** *“Stop and Think – Brain Freeze Kids Video”* or *“Red Light Green Light Brain”*  
**Link:** Search YouTube for “impulse control kids video.”  
**Purpose:** Shows how thinking can pause between feeling and doing.  
**Discussion:** “Just like in our experiment — your Idea Factory can help your Action Player pause.”  

**Materials:** video projection:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

### Part C – *MindMaster Game – ‘Trace the Action Path’* (7 min)

**Format:** Sequence Builder (Ordering)

**Flow**
1. Screen shows scrambled sequence cards; students vote order via clickers.  
2. Each scenario contains four cards: *SITUATION → THINKING → FEELING → DOING.*  
3. Students vote; app reveals correct sequence and reason.  

**Sample Scenarios (6 total)**  
- See cookie jar → Want cookie (feeling) → Think “not mine” → Don’t take it (**F → T → D**)  
- Friend calls name → Feel happy → Think “I’ll go play” → Run over (**F → T → D**)  
- Math problem on board → Think “I can solve this” → Feel determined → Write answer (**T → F → D**)  
- Someone pushes you → Feel angry → Think “tell teacher” → Walk to teacher (**F → T → D**)  
- See big dog → Feel scared → Think “stand still” → Stay frozen (**F → T → D**)  
- Plan surprise for mum → Think about ideas → Feel excited → Draw card (**T → F → D**)  

**Scoring:** 1 point per correct sequence; focus on understanding *why.*  
**Goal:** Recognise that sometimes feeling comes first, sometimes thinking — both guide the Action Player.  
**Materials:** MindMaster app; clickers:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

### Part D – *MindMaster Quiz – “Can You Control It?”* (7 min)

**Format:** Sorting Game (“I CAN CONTROL” / “I CAN’T CONTROL”).  

**Flow**
1. Statements appear one by one; students click 1 = Can Control / 2 = Can’t Control.  
2. App shows results and explains.  

**Questions (12 total)**  
- Stop myself from feeling angry → Can’t Control  
- Choose to walk away instead of hitting → Can Control  
- Stop a scary thought appearing → Can’t Control  
- Decide to raise my hand instead of shouting → Can Control  
- Make myself not feel nervous → Can’t Control  
- Keep my hands to myself even when I want to grab → Can Control  
- Stop remembering something sad → Can’t Control  
- Choose kind words even when upset → Can Control  
- Make happiness appear anytime → Can’t Control  
- Pause before I speak → Can Control  
- Stop worrying about something → Can’t Control  
- Try something even though I feel scared → Can Control  

**Feedback:** “Feelings and thoughts appear automatically — they’re messengers! But your Action Player? YOU are the boss of what you do.”  
**Scoring:** Track answers but stress learning over competition.  
**Materials:** MindMaster app; clickers:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

## Reflection (5 min) – *“My Action Player Today”*

**Steps**
1. Students complete reflection sheet:  
   - “One time today my Action Player did something I’m proud of.”  
   - “One time my Feeling or Thinking tried to make my Action Player do something, but I chose differently.”  
   - “Draw yourself using your Action Player to do something helpful.”  
2. Share 2–3 examples.  
3. Teacher reinforces: “You can’t always control thoughts and feelings, but you have strong control over your actions — and that control grows with practice!”  

**Materials:** Reflection paper and crayons:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

## Home Prep (5 min) – *“All Three Parts Together”*

**Explain:** “At home, MindMaster shows real-life videos. You’ll trace what the person might be thinking, feeling, and doing.”  
**Example:** Child sees broken toy → “What’s the child THINKING? FEELING? What can you SEE them DOING?”  
**Remind:** “You can’t see thinking or feeling, but you can guess scientifically from actions.”  
**Emphasise:** “All three parts work together — now you understand the whole system!”

## Connection to Unit Arc
This final lesson completes the three-part framework by integrating **Thinking (Idea Factory)**, **Feeling (Messenger)** and **Doing (Action Player)**.  
Students see how thinking plans, feeling sends signals, and doing makes the mind visible.  
Most importantly, they recognise agency — they cannot control thoughts or feelings appearing, but they can choose their actions.  
This scientific understanding of mind systems forms the foundation for future topics such as attention, memory, emotion, relationships and problem-solving:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}.
