## Lesson Objective
Students learn that **thinking** includes several distinct jobs—**remembering, imagining, planning, problem-solving, deciding**—and that thinking happens privately inside the mind where others cannot observe it.  
They practise using their “Idea Factory” deliberately to solve problems and recognise that thinking processes differ between individuals.

## Warm-Up (5 min) – *“The Invisible Work Challenge”*

**Steps**
1. Teacher sits silently at desk for 30 seconds, completely still.  
2. Ask: “What was I doing? Was my mind working?” (Students may say “nothing!”)  
3. Reveal: “My Idea Factory was very busy! I was remembering yesterday’s lesson, planning what to teach next, imagining what you’d say, solving how to explain thinking.”  
4. Key point: “Thinking is invisible. Even when bodies are still, Idea Factories work hard. Today we study what thinking actually does.”

**Materials:** none.

## Explore + Practice (30 min total)

### Part A – *The Many Jobs of Thinking* (10 min)

**Activity – “Idea Factory Jobs Board”**
1. Introduce five main thinking jobs with concrete examples:

| Job | Description / Example |
|-----|------------------------|
| **Remembering** | Pulling up information stored earlier – *“What did you eat for breakfast?”* |
| **Imagining** | Creating pictures or ideas of things not here – *“Imagine a purple elephant!”* |
| **Planning** | Deciding steps before doing – *“How will we clean up?”* |
| **Problem-Solving** | Figuring out answers – *“The pencil broke—now what?”* |
| **Deciding** | Choosing between options – *“Which book should I read?”* |

2. **Mini-Activity:** Teacher calls out situations; students identify which job fits.  
   - “You can’t find your shoe.” → **Problem-Solving**  
   - “Thinking about summer vacation.” → **Remembering or Imagining**  
   - “Choosing red or blue crayon.” → **Deciding**  
   - “Figuring out how to reach the high shelf.” → **Problem-Solving**  
   - “Thinking about what to do at recess before we go.” → **Planning**

**Materials:** “Idea Factory Jobs” poster (5 jobs listed).

### Psychology Video (2 min)

**Title:** *“How Does Your Brain Work? – Simple Brain for Kids”*  
**Link:** Search YouTube for *“Peekaboo Kidz How Does the Brain Work”* or similar.  
**Purpose:** Connects abstract “thinking” to the brain as its physical organ.  
**Discussion:** “Your brain is the body part that does the thinking work. It’s working right now as you learn!”  

**Materials:** video projection.

### Part B – *Psychology Experiment – “The Memory List Test” (MindMaster)* (10 min)

This experiment shows that **thinking strategies** affect how well our Idea Factory works.

**Game Flow**
1. **Setup:** Screen shows two rounds; students use clickers to answer after each.
2. **Round 1 – Random Words:** Display 8 unrelated words for 20 seconds  
   CAR, APPLE, SOCK, CLOUD, FORK, TIGER, BALL, HOUSE.  
   Then ask 5 mixed “Yes/No” questions (e.g., “Was TREE on the list?”).
3. **Round 2 – Grouped Words:** Display 8 words in categories for 20 seconds  
   APPLE, BANANA, ORANGE, GRAPE / DOG, CAT, BIRD, FISH.  
   Ask 5 similar questions.
4. **Scoring:** App tallies correct answers each round.  
5. **Compare Results:** Most students score higher in Round 2.  
6. **Debrief:** “Round 2 was easier because you used a strategy – grouping. Organised thinking helps memory work better!”

**Materials:** MindMaster app; student clickers.

### Part C – *MindMaster Game – “Problem-Solving Practice”* (10 min)

**Format:** Scenario choices (Multiple Choice)

**Flow**
1. Screen shows problem scenarios with three possible solutions.  
2. Students vote for the best answer using clickers (1, 2, or 3).  
3. Teacher reads each scenario, students think 10 seconds before clicking.  
4. Class discusses why the chosen thinking job fits.

**Sample Scenarios (6 total)**
- *Your tower keeps falling down.* → **Try different ways to stack.** (Problem-Solving)  
- *You can’t find your book.* → **Think about where you last used it.** (Remembering)  
- *Two friends want different games.* → **Deciding which to play.**  
- *You want to draw a dinosaur but don’t know how.* → **Imagining what it looks like.**  
- *The glue bottle is stuck.* → **Problem-Solving how to open it.**  
- *You need to get ready for home.* → **Planning the steps.**

**Scoring:** Discussion-based, not competitive.  
**Goal:** Identify appropriate thinking strategies.

**Materials:** MindMaster app; student clickers.

### Part D – *MindMaster Quiz – “Which Thinking Job?”* (7 min)

**Format:** Multiple Choice

**Flow**
1. Situations appear one at a time; students select 1 = Remembering, 2 = Imagining, 3 = Planning, 4 = Problem-Solving, 5 = Deciding.  
2. Teacher reads each; app shows correct answer with brief explanation.

**Questions (10 total)**
1. “What did we do at recess yesterday?” → Remembering  
2. “What would a flying elephant look like?” → Imagining  
3. “How should I get ready for home time?” → Planning  
4. “My pencil broke – what can I do?” → Problem-Solving  
5. “Should I read the red book or blue book?” → Deciding  
6. “What is my teacher’s name?” → Remembering  
7. “What if dogs could talk?” → Imagining  
8. “First I’ll clean up, then put on my coat.” → Planning  
9. “The door is stuck – how do I open it?” → Problem-Solving  
10. “Which friend should I play with today?” → Deciding  

**Feedback:** “Yes! That’s your Idea Factory using [thinking job].”  
**Scoring:** 1 point per correct answer; track class average.  
**Goal:** 7 + correct answers = students can differentiate thinking jobs.

**Materials:** MindMaster app; student clickers.

## Reflection (5 min) – *“Thinking Detectives”*

**Steps**
1. Students pair up with a picture card showing a child in a situation  
  (e.g., looking at two toys, puzzle pieces, closed door).  
2. Partners discuss: “What thinking job might this person’s Idea Factory be using?”  
3. 2–3 pairs share their answers.  
4. Teacher reinforces: “You can’t see thinking, but you can make smart scientific guesses by observing what people do.”

**Materials:** picture scenario cards (hard copy).

## Home Prep (5 min) – Preparing for MindMaster at Home

**Explain:** “At home, MindMaster will give you ‘I dea Factory Challenges.’ You’ll solve puzzles and problems, then the app asks: ‘Which thinking job did you just use?’”  
**Show:** Sample screen with puzzle and choices (Planning, Problem-Solving, Remembering).  
**Emphasise:** “After each challenge, think about what your Idea Factory did — you’re becoming a mind scientist!”  

**Materials:** MindMaster app demo.

## Connection to Unit Arc
This lesson builds on Lesson 1’s introduction of **Thinking** as one part of the mind by revealing its internal complexity and varied functions.  
Students now view thinking as a **toolbox** with different tools for different jobs.  
Lesson 3 will explore **Feeling (the Messenger)** next, followed by Lesson 4 where Thinking and Feeling guide **Doing**, completing the three-part system.
