<h2 id="lesson-1">Lesson 1 – How Our Minds Work</h2>

Students will identify the three parts of the mind (Thinking, Feeling, Doing) in everyday scenarios and recognize which part is active in different situations.

<h3 id="game-1a">HOME GAME 1A – Mind Detective: Spot the Three Parts</h3>

<p><strong>File:</strong> <code>hg-01.01-01.html</code><br>
<strong>Lesson Link:</strong> Unit 1, Lesson 1 – <em>How Our Minds Work</em></p>


### Game Format

**Observation / Spot-the-Pattern**

### Purpose

Students observe short video clips of children in daily situations and
identify which mind part(s) are most active. This game builds on the
classroom lesson by moving from labeled scenarios to observational
inference---children must watch carefully and make scientific guesses
about invisible mental processes based on visible clues.

### Setup

-   Screen opens with a friendly introduction: \"Welcome back, Mind
    > Scientist! Today you\'re a Mind Detective. You\'ll watch real kids
    > doing things and figure out what their three mind parts are
    > doing.\"

-   A simple animated character (e.g., cartoon scientist or friendly
    > animal guide) explains the task.

-   Display the three mind-part icons/labels prominently: **Thinking**
    > (lightbulb), **Feeling** (heart), **Doing** (star or running
    > figure).

-   Player sees a play button and instruction: \"Watch the video clip
    > carefully.\"

### Play

1.  **Video Clip (5--8 seconds):** A short, silent video plays showing a
    > child in a relatable situation:

    -   *Example 1:* Child looking at puzzle pieces, holding chin,
        > arranging pieces on table.

    -   *Example 2:* Child sees birthday cake, face lights up with
        > smile, claps hands.

    -   *Example 3:* Child reaches for toy, stops, looks at friend, then
        > slides toy over.

2.  **Identification Phase:** After the clip, the screen shows three
    > large buttons labeled:

    -   **1 -- Thinking** (Idea Factory)

    -   **2 -- Feeling** (Messenger)

    -   **3 -- Doing** (Action Player)

3.  **Multiple Selection:** Player taps buttons to select which part(s)
    > they think were active. (Allow multiple selections; most scenarios
    > involve 2--3 parts.)

4.  **Feedback:** After selection, neutral discovery-based feedback
    > appears:

    -   \"You noticed their **Idea Factory** was working---they were
        > figuring out the puzzle!\"

    -   \"Great observation! Their **Messenger** sent a happy feeling
        > AND their **Action Player** made them smile and clap!\"

5.  **Repeat:** Game cycles through 6--8 video clips, increasing in
    > complexity.

### Scoring

-   **Points per clip:** 1 point for each correct identification (max 3
    > points per clip if all three parts identified).

-   **Progress bar:** Visual bar shows number of clips completed (e.g.,
    > \"Clip 3 of 8\").

-   **Feedback tone:** Neutral, observation-focused (\"You
    > discovered...\" rather than \"Good job!\").

-   **No penalty for errors:** Instead, corrective feedback guides
    > learning.

### Win Condition

-   Game completes when all 8 clips are analyzed.

-   Final screen shows total points and a summary: \"You observed **X**
    > mind processes! Your mind-detective skills are growing.\"

-   Option to replay or return to home-game launcher.

### Continuity Note

This game extends Lesson 1 by requiring inference rather than sorting
pre-labeled scenarios. It prepares students for Lessons 2--4, where
they\'ll dive deeper into each mind part and must observe what\'s
happening internally based on external clues.

### Estimated Play Time

7--10 minutes

### Assets

-   **Video clips:** 8 short (5--8 sec) silent or minimal-audio videos
    > of children in daily situations (e.g., puzzle-solving, emotional
    > reactions, social interactions, waiting/pausing).

-   **UI icons:** Lightbulb (Thinking), Heart (Feeling), Star/Running
    > figure (Doing).

-   **Background:** Soft, bright, science-themed (e.g., pastel lab
    > aesthetic).

-   **Audio:** Gentle, curious background music; neutral confirmation
    > tones.

-   **Text:** Large, clear labels; age-appropriate language.

<h3 id="game-1b">HOME GAME 1B – Mind Connection: Build the Story</h3>

<p><strong>File:</strong> <code>hg-01.01-02.html</code><br>
<strong>Lesson Link:</strong> Unit 1, Lesson 1 – <em>How Our Minds Work</em></p>


Students will explain how the three parts of the mind work together and
influence each other using simple cause-and-effect language (\"I thought
about\..., then I felt\..., so I did\...\").

### Game Title

**Mind Connection: Build the Story**

### Game Format

**Sequence Builder / Cause-and-Effect Chain**

### Purpose

Students arrange scrambled cards to show how Thinking, Feeling, and
Doing connect in real-life scenarios. This game reinforces the
integrated nature of the three-part system and helps children see the
cause-and-effect pathways between internal experiences and observable
actions.

### Setup

-   Screen introduces the task: \"Let\'s see how all three mind parts
    > work together! You\'ll put the pieces of a mind story in the right
    > order.\"

-   A brief animation shows three cards shuffled on screen.

-   Instructions: \"Watch the cards. Put them in order: what happened
    > first, second, third?\"

-   Display the three-part framework as a reference banner at the top of
    > screen.

### Play

1.  **Scenario Introduction:** Screen displays a scenario headline
    > (e.g., \"Emma\'s Lost Toy\") with a simple illustration.

2.  **Card Display:** Three scrambled cards appear on screen, each
    > showing:

    -   One card: **Situation** or **Doing** (observable action) ---
        > \"Emma reaches for her toy box\"

    -   One card: **Feeling** --- \"Her Messenger sends worried
        > feeling\"

    -   One card: **Thinking** --- \"Her Idea Factory thinks: \'Where is
        > my favorite toy?\'\"

3.  **Sequencing Interaction:** Player drags and drops cards to order
    > them. Alternatively, player taps cards in order and app arranges
    > them.

4.  **Sequence Options:** Most scenarios have a clear order (Situation →
    > Thinking/Feeling → Doing), but some show (Feeling → Thinking →
    > Doing) or (Thinking → Feeling → Doing). App accepts multiple valid
    > pathways and shows them all as correct.

5.  **Reveal & Feedback:** Once sequenced correctly, the app reads the
    > story aloud in order and shows a brief animation of the sequence
    > happening:

    -   \"First, Emma looked in her toy box (Doing). Then she thought
        > \'It\'s not here\' (Thinking). Then she felt sad (Feeling).
        > Then she asked her mom for help (Doing).\"

6.  **Discussion Prompt:** Question appears: \"Why did Emma do that?\"
    > or \"What do you think happened in her mind first?\"

### Scoring

-   **Points per sequence:** 1 point for correct order; 0 for incorrect
    > (no penalty, just reset).

-   **Attempts tracked:** \"Attempt 1 of 3\" (allows multiple tries
    > before hint or skip).

-   **Hints available:** If stuck, player can tap \"Hint\" to see cards
    > rearranged slightly or get a text clue.

### Win Condition

-   All 5 scenarios completed successfully.

-   Final screen shows: \"You discovered how all three mind parts work
    > together! You\'re a Mind Connection expert.\"

-   Celebration graphic (stars, confirmatory animation).

### Continuity Note

This game reinforces the integrated, systems-based nature of the
three-part model introduced in Lesson 1. It prepares children for
Lessons 2--4 by showing that understanding one part (Thinking or
Feeling) requires understanding how it connects to the others. It also
introduces the idea that the mind parts can influence each other in
different sequences depending on the situation.

### Estimated Play Time

6--9 minutes

### Assets

-   **Scenario cards:** 5 sets of 3 cards each; illustrated scenes
    > (e.g., Emma\'s toy box, friend\'s birthday, forgotten lunch).

-   **Card images:** Simple, clear illustrations on each card showing
    > action, feeling expression, or thinking symbol.

-   **Drag-and-drop UI:** Smooth animations, clear drop zones.

-   **Animation:** Brief sequence animations that show the scenario
    > playing out once cards are in order.

-   **Audio:** Narration of sequenced story; gentle sound effects for
    > correct placement.

-   **Background:** Same bright, science-themed aesthetic as Home Game
    > 1A.

<h2 id="lesson-2">Lesson 2 – Thinking – Our Mind’s Idea Factory</h2>

Students will identify at least three different types of thinking their Idea Factory does (remembering, imagining, planning, problem-solving, deciding) and give examples from their own experience.

<h3 id="game-2a">HOME GAME 2A – Idea Factory: What’s the Job?</h3>

<p><strong>File:</strong> <code>hg-01.02-01.html</code><br>
<strong>Lesson Link:</strong> Unit 1, Lesson 2 – <em>Thinking – Our Mind’s Idea Factory</em></p>

### Game Format

**Sorting / Categorizing**

### Purpose

Students sort descriptions of thinking activities into categories based
on the thinking job being used. This game helps children recognize the
diversity of thinking processes and see that \"thinking\" isn\'t a
single action but a collection of different mental jobs happening
constantly.

### Setup

-   Screen opens with: \"Welcome to the Idea Factory! Your brain does
    > many different thinking jobs all day long. Let\'s sort them!\"

-   Display five large sorting bins labeled:

    -   **1 -- REMEMBERING** (brain with storage icon)

    -   **2 -- IMAGINING** (brain with stars/dreaming icon)

    -   **3 -- PLANNING** (brain with checklist/steps icon)

    -   **4 -- PROBLEM-SOLVING** (brain with puzzle icon)

    -   **5 -- DECIDING** (brain with two-path icon)

-   Bins stay visible throughout the game.

### Play

1.  **Scenario Card Appears:** One thinking-job scenario card slides
    > onto screen at the top (e.g., \"Wondering what ice cream flavor
    > you like best\").

2.  **Player Sorts:** Player taps or drags the card into the correct bin
    > (or taps the bin number).

3.  **Feedback:** Card drops into bin with a satisfying animation. Text
    > appears:

    -   Correct: \"That\'s **DECIDING**! Your Idea Factory was choosing
        > between options.\"

    -   Incorrect: \"Not quite. Let\'s think\... this job is about \[job
        > name\]. Here\'s why: \[explanation\].\"

4.  **Repeat:** New scenario card appears. 8--10 scenarios total, with
    > increasing subtlety.

5.  **Sample Scenarios:**

    -   \"You remember what you had for breakfast\" → **REMEMBERING**

    -   \"You think about what a flying dinosaur would look like\" →
        > **IMAGINING**

    -   \"You plan the order you\'ll get dressed\" → **PLANNING**

    -   \"Your pencil breaks, so you figure out what to do\" →
        > **PROBLEM-SOLVING**

    -   \"You choose between the red crayon and the blue crayon\" →
        > **DECIDING**

    -   \"You wonder if it will rain tomorrow\" → **IMAGINING** (or
        > **WONDERING**, which could map to IMAGINING/PLANNING)

### Scoring

-   **1 point per correct sort.**

-   **Progress indicator:** \"5 of 10 thinking jobs sorted.\"

-   **No penalty:** Wrong sorts simply reset and offer corrective
    > feedback.

-   **Accuracy tracked:** Final score shown as percentage (\"You sorted
    > 8 out of 10 correctly!\").

### Win Condition

-   All 8--10 scenarios sorted.

-   Final screen shows the five bins filled with sorted cards and a
    > summary: \"Your Idea Factory does **5 different jobs**! Which one
    > was busiest today?\"

-   Optional reflection prompt: Player can tap each bin to see examples
    > again.

### Continuity Note

This game extends Lesson 2 by allowing independent practice in
recognizing thinking-job categories without classroom scaffolding. It
bridges to Lesson 3 by preparing children to see that Feeling and Doing
also have multiple types---the mind is a system of diverse processes,
not a simple on/off.

### Estimated Play Time

5--8 minutes

### Assets

-   **Sorting bins:** 5 large, labeled containers with icons (storage,
    > stars, checklist, puzzle, paths).

-   **Scenario cards:** 8--10 illustrated or text-based cards showing
    > thinking-job examples.

-   **UI animations:** Smooth card-drop animations; bin highlights when
    > active.

-   **Icons:** Clear, distinct icons for each thinking job.

-   **Background:** Bright factory/workshop aesthetic; soft color
    > palette.

-   **Audio:** Satisfying \"drop\" sounds; gentle background music.

##  

<h3 id="game-2b">HOME GAME 2B – Pause & Think: The Problem Solver</h3>

<p><strong>File:</strong> <code>hg-01.02-02.html</code><br>
<strong>Lesson Link:</strong> Unit 1, Lesson 2 – <em>Thinking – Our Mind’s Idea Factory</em></p>


Students will demonstrate the practice of \"thinking before acting\" by
pausing to use their Idea Factory in a scenario and explaining what they
thought about before deciding what to do.

### Game Title

**Pause & Think: The Problem Solver**

### Game Format

**Build & Test / Scenario Choices**

### Purpose

Students encounter problems and must use deliberate thinking (generating
multiple solutions) before choosing an action. This game models the
metacognitive practice of \"thinking before doing\" and reinforces that
the Idea Factory can be used intentionally as a tool.

### Setup

-   Screen opens: \"You\'re a Problem Solver! Your Idea Factory can help
    > you find the BEST way to handle tricky situations.\"

-   A friendly character (problem-solving guide) introduces the task:
    > \"I\'ll show you a problem. You think of as many solutions as you
    > can. Then we\'ll pick the best one together.\"

-   Instructions: \"Tap the bulbs to add ideas. When you\'re ready, tap
    > the best idea.\"

### Play

1.  **Problem Scenario:** Screen displays a simple problem with an
    > illustration:

    -   *Example 1:* \"You want to build a really tall tower, but your
        > blocks keep falling down.\"

    -   *Example 2:* \"You can\'t find your shoe before school.\"

    -   *Example 3:* \"Two friends want you to play different games at
        > recess.\"

2.  **Idea Generation Phase:** Below the problem, several lightbulb
    > icons appear (5--7 bulbs). Each bulb contains a possible solution
    > (pre-written; not open-ended for this age).

3.  **Exploration:** Player taps each lightbulb to reveal an idea:

    -   Bulb 1: \"Try stacking blocks differently.\"

    -   Bulb 2: \"Ask a grown-up to help.\"

    -   Bulb 3: \"Use a different type of block.\"

    -   Bulb 4: \"Build it lower so it\'s more stable.\"

    -   Etc.

4.  **Thinking Discussion:** After revealing all ideas, a prompt
    > appears: \"Which idea do YOU think would work best? Why?\"

5.  **Selection & Test:** Player taps their chosen solution. A brief
    > animation or text shows the outcome:

    -   If \"Try stacking blocks differently\": Animation shows blocks
        > stacking successfully.

    -   If \"Ask a grown-up to help\": Animation shows adult and child
        > building together.

    -   Feedback: \"Great thinking! Using your Idea Factory to
        > **\[generate multiple ideas / think before acting\]** helps
        > you find good solutions!\"

6.  **Optional \"Why\" Discussion:** Follow-up prompt: \"Why did this
    > idea work better than the others?\" (Narrative or open-ended
    > reflection---not graded.)

### Scoring

-   **1 point for attempting the problem.**

-   **Bonus point for selecting a reasonable solution** (most answers
    > are acceptable; only extremely off-target solutions are flagged).

-   **Thinking-points tracked:** \"You used your Idea Factory **2 times
    > today!**\"

-   **Focus on process, not \"correctness\":** Emphasis is on the
    > practice of pausing and generating options, not on picking the
    > \"right\" answer.

### Win Condition

-   All 4--5 problem scenarios encountered and solved.

-   Final screen celebrates: \"You\'re a Problem Solver! Your Idea
    > Factory helped you think through **\[number\]** tricky situations.
    > Every time you **pause and think**, you get better at solving
    > problems!\"

-   Option to replay or return to launcher.

### Continuity Note

This game models the metacognitive practice emphasized in Lesson
2---using thinking deliberately as a tool. It also sets up Lesson 3 by
showing how thinking can influence what happens next (thinking →
decision → action). In Lesson 4, children will see how this extends
further: thinking can also help manage or understand feelings.

### Estimated Play Time

6--9 minutes

### Assets

-   **Problem scenario illustrations:** 4--5 simple, relatable problem
    > scenes.

-   **Lightbulb icons:** 5--7 interactive bulbs per scenario; glow on
    > tap.

-   **Solution cards:** Text or mini-illustrations showing each idea.

-   **Animation:** Brief outcome animation after selection.

-   **UI:** Large tappable bulbs; clear, readable solution text.

-   **Audio:** \"Lightbulb\" sound on tap; gentle success tones.

-   **Background:** Bright, problem-solving themed (e.g., workshop,
    > brainstorm aesthetic).

##  

<h2 id="lesson-3">Lesson 3 – Feeling – Our Mind’s Messenger</h2>

Students will identify at least four different feelings by name and
describe what information each one communicates (e.g., \"Fear warns me
about danger\").

<h3 id="game-3a">HOME GAME 3A – Messenger Messages: What’s the Signal?</h3>

<p><strong>File:</strong> <code>hg-01.03-01.html</code><br>
<strong>Lesson Link:</strong> Unit 1, Lesson 3 – <em>Feeling – Our Mind’s Messenger</em></p>

### Game Format

**Matching / Pairing**

### Purpose

Students match feeling-information pairs to understand that feelings
aren\'t random emotions but useful data signals. This game reinforces
the core Lesson 3 concept: every feeling carries a message.

### Setup

-   Screen opens: \"Your Messenger sends you important messages every
    > day! Let\'s figure out what each feeling is telling you.\"

-   Display two columns:

    -   **Left column:** Feeling faces/names (e.g., SCARED, SAD, ANGRY,
        > EXCITED, WORRIED)

    -   **Right column:** Information messages (e.g., \"Something might
        > hurt me,\" \"Something important is gone,\" \"Something seems
        > unfair,\" \"Something good is happening,\" \"I\'m not sure
        > what will happen\")

-   Instructions: \"Connect each feeling to the message it sends.\"

### Play

1.  **Matching Interface:** Screen shows 5 feeling cards on the left and
    > 5 message cards on the right (or shuffled on a single screen).

2.  **Pairing Action:** Player taps a feeling card, then taps the
    > matching message card (or drags feeling to message).

3.  **Connection Animation:** If correct, a line or arc draws between
    > them and they both glow. Text confirms: \"**SCARED** tells you:
    > **\'Something might hurt me---watch out!\'**\"

4.  **Feedback on Incorrect Pairing:** If wrong, cards briefly shake and
    > feedback appears: \"That\'s not quite right. Let\'s think\... what
    > does **SCARED** warn you about?\" Blocks the pairing and allows
    > retry.

5.  **Progression:** Multiple rounds with increasing complexity:

    -   **Round 1:** 5 core feelings + 5 basic messages (easy match).

    -   **Round 2:** Same feelings + slightly more nuanced messages
        > (\"Something that matters to me is gone or broken\" instead of
        > just \"Something is gone\").

    -   **Round 3 (optional advanced):** Introduce secondary feelings
        > (e.g., SURPRISED, CURIOUS, FRUSTRATED) if player completes
        > rounds 1--2 quickly.

### Scoring

-   **1 point per correct pairing.**

-   **Attempts tracked:** \"5 of 5 matched!\"

-   **Completion indicator:** Progress bar fills as pairs are connected.

-   **Neutral feedback:** \"You discovered what that Messenger was
    > saying!\"

### Win Condition

-   All 5 (or 7--8 in extended mode) feeling-message pairs matched.

-   Final screen displays all pairs graphically and affirms: \"Every
    > feeling sends a useful message! You now understand **\[number\]**
    > Messenger signals.\"

-   Celebration animation (e.g., hearts, lightbulbs, confirmatory design
    > elements).

### Continuity Note

This game introduces feeling-as-information framework in isolation,
preparing for Home Game 3B where students see how feelings manifest
physically and vary between people. It also bridges to Lesson 4, where
feelings will be shown influencing actions.

### Estimated Play Time

5--7 minutes

### Assets

-   **Feeling cards:** 5 illustrated emotion faces or icons (SCARED,
    > SAD, ANGRY, EXCITED, WORRIED).

-   **Message cards:** 5 text-based message descriptions (large, clear
    > font).

-   **Connection UI:** Lines or arcs drawn between matches; smooth
    > animation.

-   **Icons:** Simple, expressive emotion illustrations.

-   **Background:** Warm, welcoming, messenger/communication themed
    > (e.g., soft pastels, speech bubbles).

-   **Audio:** Confirmation tones; gentle background music.

##  

<h3 id="game-3b">HOME GAME 3B – Body Map: Feel It and Share It</h3>

<p><strong>File:</strong> <code>hg-01.03-02.html</code><br>
<strong>Lesson Link:</strong> Unit 1, Lesson 3 – <em>Feeling – Our Mind’s Messenger</em></p>

Students will locate where specific feelings appear in their body and
recognize that the same situation can create different feelings in
different people.

### Game Title

**Body Map: Feel It and Share It**

### Game Format

**Observation / Spot-the-Pattern + Scenario Choices**

### Purpose

This game combines two Lesson 3 objectives: helping students recognize
that feelings have physical locations in the body AND that different
people feel differently in the same situation. It models both
self-awareness (noticing body sensations) and empathy (understanding
others\' different responses).

### Setup

-   **Phase 1 (Individual Body Mapping):**

    -   Screen displays: \"Feelings happen in your body too! Where do
        > YOU feel different feelings?\"

    -   Shows an outline of a child\'s body with 5 labeled zones: HEAD,
        > CHEST, STOMACH, ARMS/HANDS, LEGS.

    -   Instructions: \"Tap the body part where you feel each feeling.\"

-   **Phase 2 (Social Comparison):**

    -   After personal mapping, screen shows: \"Now let\'s see where
        > other kids feel the same feelings!\"

    -   Displays scenario comparison mode.

### Play

**Phase 1: Personal Body Mapping (5 minutes)**

1.  **Feeling Prompt:** Screen shows one feeling at a time (e.g.,
    > \"NERVOUS\").

2.  **Body Selection:** Player taps the body zone(s) where they feel
    > nervousness (multiple zones can be selected).

3.  **Validation:** App acknowledges choice with neutral feedback: \"You
    > feel nervous in your **stomach**! That\'s where many kids feel it
    > too.\"

4.  **Data Display:** As each feeling is mapped, a simple heat map
    > appears, showing which zones were selected:

    -   Screen shows outline with zones glowing in different
        > colors/intensities based on selections.

5.  **Repeat for 4--5 feelings:**

    -   NERVOUS

    -   HAPPY/EXCITED

    -   SCARED

    -   SAD

    -   ANGRY

**Phase 2: Social Comparison (3--4 minutes)**

1.  **Scenario Presented:** Screen shows a scenario with an illustration
    > (e.g., \"First day at a new school\").

2.  **Multiple Perspectives:** App shows 2--3 character reactions to the
    > same scenario:

    -   *Character A:* \"I felt excited! Butterflies in my stomach and
        > racing heart.\"

    -   *Character B:* \"I felt scared and nervous. My shoulders got
        > tight.\"

    -   *Character C:* \"I felt curious and calm. My hands felt ready to
        > explore.\"

3.  **Heat Map Comparison:** Each character\'s response displays as a
    > simple body-zone visualization (which zones lit up for them).

4.  **Discussion Prompt:** \"Same school, different feelings! Why do you
    > think **\[Character A and B\]** felt so differently?\"

5.  **Reflection (Optional Open-Ended):** Player can tap to hear or read
    > a simple explanation: \"Everyone\'s Messenger works differently.
    > What matters to one person feels different to another---and
    > that\'s normal!\"

### Scoring

-   **Phase 1:** 1 point per feeling mapped (5 points max). No wrong
    > answers---goal is personal discovery.

-   **Phase 2:** No points; focus is on observation and discussion.
    > \"You discovered that different people feel feelings in different
    > ways!\"

-   **Completion badge:** \"Body Map Explorer\" badge or star awarded
    > after both phases.

### Win Condition

-   All 5 feelings mapped in Phase 1.

-   All 2--3 scenarios compared in Phase 2.

-   Final screen shows: \"Your Messenger works in unique ways! And
    > everyone else\'s does too. That\'s what makes us different---and
    > that\'s okay!\"

### Continuity Note

This game completes Lesson 3\'s learning objectives by showing the
physical dimension of feelings AND normalizing individual differences.
It sets up Lesson 4 by establishing that while internal experiences
(feelings) vary, observable actions (doing) are what we can actually see
in others---connecting the framework back to the integration of all
three parts.

### Estimated Play Time

8--10 minutes

### Assets

-   **Body outline illustration:** Simple, child-friendly body
    > silhouette with clear zone labels.

-   **Heat-map visualization:** Simple color gradients showing intensity
    > in each zone (e.g., stomach glows more for nervous, chest for
    > excited).

-   **Scenario illustrations:** 2--3 scenarios with character reactions
    > (e.g., first day, birthday party, thunderstorm).

-   **Character icons/avatars:** Simple, diverse representation of
    > children.

<h2 id="lesson-4">Lesson 4 – Doing – Our Mind’s Action Player</h2>

Students will identify at least four types of observable actions their
Action Player produces (speaking, facial expressions, body movements,
gestures, or choosing to wait) and distinguish between actions they can
control and thoughts/feelings they cannot control.

<p><strong>File:</strong> <code>hg-01.04-01.html</code><br>
<strong>Lesson Link:</strong> Unit 1, Lesson 4 – <em>Doing – Our Mind’s Action Player</em></p>

### Game Format

**Observation / Spot-the-Pattern + Sorting**

### Purpose

Students observe videos or images of observable actions and categorize
them by type (speaking, moving, face, gesture, waiting). They also begin
to practice the key Lesson 4 insight: actions are VISIBLE to others,
while thoughts and feelings are INVISIBLE. This lays groundwork for
understanding agency and control.

### Setup

-   Screen opens: \"Welcome to the Action Player! Everything you DO is
    > visible to others. Let\'s spot the different types of doing!\"

-   Display 5 action categories with icons:

    -   **1 -- SPEAKING** (mouth/speech bubble)

    -   **2 -- MOVING** (running/body)

    -   **3 -- FACE** (smiling/expression)

    -   **4 -- GESTURE** (waving/hand signal)

    -   **5 -- WAITING** (pause/stillness)

-   Instructions: \"Watch what the person DOES. Which type of action is
    > it?\"

### Play

1.  **Video/Image Clip (3--5 sec):** Screen displays a short clip
    > showing a child performing an action:

    -   *Example 1:* Child saying \"Hello!\" (SPEAKING)

    -   *Example 2:* Child running to playground (MOVING)

    -   *Example 3:* Child smiling big smile (FACE)

    -   *Example 4:* Child waving goodbye (GESTURE)

    -   *Example 5:* Child standing still, waiting for turn (WAITING)

2.  **Identification:** After clip, player taps the category button
    > (1--5) that matches what they saw.

3.  **Feedback:** App confirms with description:

    -   \"That\'s **SPEAKING**! You could hear the words they
        > said---that\'s an Action Player doing!\"

    -   \"Right! That\'s **MOVING**---their body changed places, and
        > everyone could see it happen!\"

    -   Etc.

4.  **Hidden vs. Visible Follow-Up (optional):** After action is
    > identified, app asks: \"That\'s what we can SEE. But what was
    > happening INSIDE their mind? We can only guess!\"

    -   This reinforces that actions are observable but
        > thoughts/feelings are not.

5.  **Repeat:** 6--8 clips total, covering all 5 action types multiple
    > times.

### Scoring

-   **1 point per correct identification.**

-   **Progress bar:** \"4 of 8 actions spotted!\"

-   **Accuracy tracked:** Final score as percentage.

-   **No penalty:** Wrong categorizations reset and offer corrective
    > feedback.

### Win Condition

-   All 6--8 action clips categorized.

-   Final screen shows all 5 action types with checkmarks and affirms:
    > \"Your Action Player does **\[number\]** different types of
    > visible actions! Everything you DO, others can see.\"

-   Optional reflection: \"Now that you know what others can SEE, think
    > about: What can\'t they see? **(Answer: Your thinking and
    > feeling!)**\"

### Continuity Note

This game directly extends Lesson 4\'s first half by helping students
recognize observable action diversity. It bridges to Home Game 4B by
establishing the foundation: actions are visible, while internal
experiences are not. This distinction is crucial for understanding
agency in the next game.

### Estimated Play Time

6--8 minutes

### Assets

-   **Action-type category buttons:** 5 large, labeled buttons with
    > clear icons.

-   **Video clips:** 6--8 short (3--5 sec) clips of children performing
    > observable actions.

-   **UI icons:** Distinct, simple icons for each action type (mouth,
    > running figure, smiley face, waving hand, pause symbol).

-   **Feedback text:** Large, clear descriptions of each action.

-   **Background:** Bright, action-themed (e.g., stage, spotlight,
    > performance aesthetic).

-   **Audio:** Action-confirming sounds (speech sound for SPEAKING,
    > footsteps for MOVING, etc.); gentle background music.

<h3 id="game-4b">HOME GAME 4B – Pause & Choose: The Three Parts in Action</h3>

<p><strong>File:</strong> <code>hg-01.04-02.html</code><br>
<strong>Lesson Link:</strong> Unit 1, Lesson 4 – <em>Doing – Our Mind’s Action Player</em></p>

Students will explain how thinking and feeling each guide actions in
different ways and demonstrate the pause between thinking/feeling and
doing by choosing different actions in scenarios.

### Game Title

**Pause & Choose: The Three Parts in Action**

### Game Format

**Scenario Choices + Sequence Builder**

### Purpose

This culminating game integrates all three mind parts by showing
students how thinking and feeling both guide their Action Player in
real-life situations. Critically, it emphasizes that there is a
PAUSE---a moment where students can choose---between feeling/thinking
and doing. This embodies the Lesson 4 concept of agency: you can\'t
always control your thoughts or feelings, but you CAN control your
actions.

### Setup

-   Screen opens with a recap: \"Thinking, Feeling, and Doing work
    > together! Your Idea Factory and Messenger both guide what your
    > Action Player does. But here\'s the powerful part: **YOU can
    > choose!**\"

-   A friendly character explains: \"In tricky moments, you can PAUSE
    > and choose what to do. Let\'s practice.\"

-   Instructions: \"You\'ll face a feeling. Before your Action Player
    > acts, you\'ll THINK and CHOOSE.\"

### Play

1.  **Scenario & Feeling Trigger:** Screen shows a scenario with an
    > illustration:

    -   *Example 1:* \"Your friend took the toy you were playing with.
        > You feel **ANGRY**.\"

    -   *Example 2:* \"You see the test paper on the teacher\'s desk.
        > You feel **NERVOUS**.\"

    -   *Example 3:* \"You\'re about to try something you\'ve never done
        > before. You feel **SCARED**.\"

2.  **Feeling Confirmation:** App displays the feeling prominently and
    > asks: \"Your Messenger is sending you a
    > **\[ANGRY/NERVOUS/SCARED\]** feeling. That\'s normal! Now\... what
    > happens next?\"

3.  **The Pause Moment:** A PAUSE animation or effect appears (e.g.,
    > time slows, a big PAUSE button, or a screen showing \"Time to
    > THINK!\").

4.  **Action Choices:** Three to four possible actions appear as
    > buttons:

    -   *For ANGRY scenario:*

        -   A\) Yell and grab the toy back

        -   B\) Walk away and cool down

        -   C\) Tell a teacher

        -   D\) Ask nicely for a turn

    -   *For NERVOUS scenario:*

        -   A\) Hide under the desk

        -   B\) Take deep breaths and look at the test

        -   C\) Ask the teacher for help

        -   D\) Doodle and avoid thinking about it

5.  **Thinking Prompt:** Before showing outcomes, app prompts: \"What
    > would your Idea Factory THINK about each choice? Let\'s see what
    > happens.\"

6.  **Outcome Simulation (Branching):** Player taps their chosen action.
    > A brief narrative or animation shows the likely outcome:

    -   If \"Yell and grab\": \"You got the toy back, but now your
        > friend is upset. The teacher noticed and you\'re both in
        > trouble.\"

    -   If \"Walk away and cool down\": \"You felt angry, but after a
        > minute, your feelings calmed down. Your friend came and asked
        > if you wanted to play together. You felt better!\"

    -   If \"Tell a teacher\": \"The teacher helped you both take turns.
        > It worked out fairly.\"

    -   Etc.

7.  **Reflection Prompt:** After outcome, app asks: \"What do you
    > notice? Did pausing and thinking help?\"

    -   Expected discovery: \"When I paused and thought, I could choose
        > an action that felt better.\"

8.  **Insight Summary:** App reinforces: \"You couldn\'t stop feeling
    > **ANGRY**, but your Idea Factory helped your Action Player CHOOSE
    > what to do. That\'s your power!\"

9.  **Repeat:** 3--4 scenarios with different feelings and action
    > choices.

### Scoring

-   **No \"wrong\" answer scoring.** All choices lead to outcomes; goal
    > is learning, not perfection.

-   **Reflection points:** 1 point per scenario completed; emphasis on
    > the process of pausing and thinking.

-   **Agency tracking:** \"You paused and chose **4 times today!**\"
    > (counts deliberate pause-and-choose moments).

-   **Feedback tone:** Neutral, discovery-based. \"You discovered that
    > pausing gives you choices.\"

### Win Condition

-   All 3--4 scenarios encountered and choice made for each.

-   Final screen celebrates integration: \"You understand how all THREE
    > parts work together! You can\'t always control your Thinking and
    > Feeling, but you CAN control your Doing. That\'s the power of the
    > pause.\"

-   Completion badge or summary showing all scenarios with outcomes.

-   Option to replay or return to home-game launcher.

### Continuity Note

This game completes Unit 1 by integrating all three mind parts and
emphasizing the crucial concept of agency---the learner\'s ability to
pause and choose their actions even when thoughts and feelings are
automatic. This directly supports the unit\'s goal of building
self-efficacy (\"I can use my mind parts together to make good
choices\") and mental resilience (\"I can pause and think before I
act\"). It also sets up future units by establishing that understanding
mental processes gives children real power and control over their lives.

### Estimated Play Time

8--10 minutes

### Assets

-   **Scenario illustrations:** 3--4 relatable, emotion-triggering
    > scenarios (stealing, testing, new challenge, sibling conflict).

-   **Feeling icons:** Clear emotion displays (ANGRY, NERVOUS, SCARED,
    > etc.).

-   **Action choice buttons:** 3--4 large, tappable buttons with simple
    > text descriptions.

-   **Outcome animations/narratives:** Brief sequence animations or
    > illustrated outcomes for each choice (showing consequence, not
    > judgment).

-   **PAUSE graphic:** Prominent visual effect emphasizing the pause
    > moment (e.g., time-slowing animation, highlighter effect).

-   **UI:** Clear, intuitive button layout; large, readable text.

-   **Audio:** Thoughtful background music during pause moment; neutral
    > confirmation tones for choices; outcome sound effects.

-   **Background:** Calm, empowering aesthetic (e.g., mountain summit,
    > light, growth imagery).
