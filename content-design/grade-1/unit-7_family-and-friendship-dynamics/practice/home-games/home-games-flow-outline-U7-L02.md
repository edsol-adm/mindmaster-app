## Home Game 2A – Friendship Island Explorer
> Jump to: [Setup](#setup) · [Play](#play) · [Scoring](#scoring) · [Win Condition](#win-condition) · [Continuity Note](#continuity-note)

### Learning Objective
Students will identify the key qualities that make friendships strong (kindness, listening, trust, sharing, taking turns, respect) and understand that being a good friend is a learnable skill that improves with practice.

### Game File Name & Format
`hg-07.02-01.html` — Exploration/Discovery (Adventure Game - navigate environment, unlock areas)

### Game Purpose
This game teaches that friendship skills are discoverable, learnable abilities that can be practiced and mastered. By exploring distinct island regions (each representing a friendship skill), children learn to identify and differentiate the six core friendship qualities through active discovery rather than passive instruction.

### Estimated Play Time
8–12 minutes (6 regions, approximately 1–2 minutes per region to find 3 gems; longer if seeking all sparkles)

### Continuity Note
This game builds on Lesson 2’s teaching that friendship skills are identifiable and learnable by transforming them into explorable territories. The discovery mechanic reinforces that children can actively seek out and practice these behaviors. It prepares for Game 2B (cause-and-effect of friendship actions) by first establishing what the six skills look like in action. The exploration format builds curiosity and mastery while connecting to Lesson 3 by showing that understanding friendship behaviors helps navigate relationship challenges.

### Continuity Note
This game builds on Game 2A’s skill identification by showing the cause-effect patterns of friendship behaviors in action. The chain-reaction mechanic demonstrates that friendship isn't random—specific actions produce predictable positive outcomes. It prepares for Lesson 3 by establishing that understanding these patterns helps navigate conflicts (conflicts are just negative chains that can be redirected into positive ones using problem-solving). The scientific framing reinforces psychology as an observable, learnable system.

## How Lesson 2 Fits into the Full Learning Arc

Lesson 2 extends the shift from individual understanding to social systems by moving from **family teamwork** to **friendship as a learnable skill**. The two home games translate this into practice: *Friendship Island Explorer* helps students **identify and name** the six core friendship skills through discovery, while *Kindness Chain Reaction* shows how **specific actions** reliably produce **positive social effects**. Together, they reinforce that friendship competence grows through observation, practice, and feedback—not through personality or luck.

- **Lesson 1:** Establishes family as the foundational social system where cooperation, role-distribution, and mutual support are first learned.  
- **Lesson 2 (this document):** Frames friendship as a **skill set**—kindness, listening, sharing, taking turns, trust, and respect—that can be **observed, practiced, and improved** through deliberate actions.  
- **Lesson 3:** Normalizes conflict as part of relationships and teaches **cooperative problem-solving** to repair and strengthen friendships when challenges arise.  
- **Lesson 4:** Broadens perspective to **inclusion and empathy**, emphasizing that families and friendships come in many forms, and that **care and respect**—not uniformity—make relationships strong.

> 🧠 **Learning Arc Summary:** Family as Team → Friendship as Skill → Problem-Solving as Cooperation → Diversity as Strength.  
> By progressing from structural understanding (family teams) to actionable skills (friendship behaviors), students build **self-efficacy** (“I can do friendship well”) that prepares them to handle conflict constructively and to value diversity with empathy—key steps toward social **resilience**.
