## Home Game 1A – Family Role Relay
> Jump to: [Setup](#setup) · [Play](#play) · [Scoring](#scoring) · [Win Condition](#win-condition) · [Continuity Note](#continuity-note)

### Learning Objective
Students will understand that families function as teams in which members have different roles and responsibilities, and that families support one another to help the group function well—regardless of what the family looks like.

### Game File Name & Format
`hg-07.01-01.html` — Endless Runner (Action Game with role-collection mechanic)

### Game Purpose
This game reinforces that family teams require diverse roles and that everyone contributes to family functioning. By collecting role tokens and avoiding "solo player" obstacles, children learn that teamwork (multiple roles) creates stronger family systems than individual effort alone.

### Estimated Play Time
5–8 minutes (varies based on player skill; can be shorter if Family Team Meter depletes quickly or longer in endless mode)

---

### Setup
**Opening Screen:**  
- Title: "Family Role Relay"  
- Visual: Cartoon house cross-section showing different rooms (kitchen, living room, bedroom, yard)  
- Character avatar (customizable child character) standing at start line  
- Introduction text: "Families work best when everyone helps! Run through the house and collect family role tokens. The more roles you gather, the stronger the family team becomes!"  
- Tutorial prompt: "Swipe up to jump, swipe down to slide, tap to collect tokens"  
- Button: "Start Running!"  

**Tutorial (10 seconds):**  
- Character runs automatically (slow speed initially)  
- Three role tokens appear: "Cooking," "Cleaning," "Caring"  
- Arrow prompts player to tap each token  
- Text: "Great! You collected 3 roles. Families are stronger when everyone helps!"  

---

### Play
**Core Gameplay Loop:**  

**Continuous Running:**  
- Character runs automatically from left to right through house cross-section  
- Player controls: Swipe up (jump over obstacles), Swipe down (slide under obstacles), Tap tokens (collect roles)  
- Speed gradually increases every 30 seconds  

**Role Tokens (collectibles):**  
Six types appear randomly throughout the house:  
- 🍳 Cooking (kitchen area)  
- 🧹 Cleaning (living room/bedroom)  
- 🐕 Pet Care (yard)  
- 📚 Homework Help (bedroom)  
- 🌱 Plant Care (yard/kitchen)  
- 🛠️ Fixing Things (various rooms)  

Each token collected = +1 role added to "Family Team Meter" (visual bar at top showing how many roles are being handled)

**Obstacles to Avoid:**  
- "Do Everything Alone" blocks (large gray blocks with sad face) - If hit, lose 2 role tokens from meter  
- "Ignore Responsibilities" holes (gaps in floor) - Must jump over; if fall in, lose 1 role token  
- "Too Busy" walls (must slide under low openings)  

**Power-Ups:**  
- "Team Meeting" star (golden star icon) - Temporarily doubles role token collection for 10 seconds  
- "Help from Grown-Up" shield (blue shield) - Protects from one obstacle hit  

**Environmental Changes (every 100 meters):**  
- Kitchen → Living Room → Bedroom → Yard → repeat  
- Each room has thematic role tokens appropriate to that space  
- Visual feedback: Family Team Meter glows brighter as more roles collected  

**Challenge Moments (every 30 seconds):**  
- Screen prompt: "Family Challenge!"  
- Multiple role tokens appear in sequence  
- Player must collect 5+ tokens quickly (15 seconds)  
- Success = bonus +5 to Family Team Meter + "Strong Family!" message  
- Miss = continue normally  

---

### Scoring
**Distance-Based Scoring:**  
- Primary Score: Distance traveled in meters (e.g., "You helped your family for 450 meters!")  
- Role Token Counter: Total roles collected (displayed as "Family Roles Gathered: 87")  
- Family Team Meter: Shows current active roles (max 20; resets if meter drops to 0)  

**Achievement Levels:**  
- 0–200m = "Family Helper" (bronze badge)  
- 201–500m = "Team Player" (silver badge)  
- 501–1000m = "Family Champion" (gold badge)  
- 1000m+ = "Super Team Member" (platinum badge + special animation)  

**Bonus Points:**  
- Each Challenge Moment completed: +50 meters bonus  
- Power-up collected: +10 meters bonus  
- Streak bonus: Collect 10 tokens without hitting obstacle = +25 meters

### Continuity Note
This game introduces the concept that family systems require distributed roles through active gameplay. The running mechanic creates urgency and engagement while the role-collection reinforces that multiple responsibilities strengthen the family. It prepares players for Game 1B (building stable family structures) and connects to Lesson 2's friendship dynamics by establishing that all social groups involve distributed contributions.

### Continuity Note
This game reinforces Game 1A's concept of distributed family roles by requiring physical balance and stability. The physics-based stacking demonstrates that family systems need careful configuration and mutual support. It prepares for Lesson 2 by showing that balance and cooperation aren't just family concepts—they apply to all relationships. The stability mechanic emphasizes that strong systems (families, friendships) require thoughtful arrangement and support.

## How Lesson 1 Fits into the Full Learning Arc

Lesson 1 introduces **the family as a child’s first team**, marking the shift from understanding individual psychological processes to exploring social systems. The two home games transform this idea into embodied learning: *Family Role Relay* illustrates that families thrive when responsibilities are shared rather than carried alone, while *Teamwork Tower Builder* deepens that understanding through balance and structure, showing that stability arises from cooperation among diverse roles.

- **Lesson 1 (this document):** Establishes family as the foundational social system where cooperation, care, and role-distribution are first learned.  
- **Lesson 2:** Extends these teamwork principles into friendships, where children apply cooperation skills outside the family to peers.  
- **Lesson 3:** Introduces conflict as a normal part of relationships and teaches cooperative problem-solving as the mechanism that keeps teams strong.  
- **Lesson 4:** Broadens perspective toward inclusion and empathy, emphasizing that families and friendships come in many forms, and strength lies in care and respect, not uniformity.

> 🧠 **Learning Arc Summary:** Family as Team → Friendship as Skill → Problem-Solving as Cooperation → Diversity as Strength.  
> Through this arc, students progress from understanding the *structure* of supportive systems (family) to the *skills* that sustain them (friendship, conflict resolution, empathy). The focus on cooperation, balance, and respect equips learners with social self-efficacy—confidence that they can contribute to relationships constructively and adaptively, forming the bridge between psychological literacy and social resilience.
