### Learning Objective
Students will recognize and celebrate the diversity of family structures and friendship patterns, understanding that what makes relationships strong is the quality of care, respect, and support within them, not their external form.

### Game File Name & Format
`hg-07.04-01.html` — Hidden Object (find caring behaviors in diverse scenes)

### Game Purpose
This game teaches that the defining features of strong relationships (care, respect, support, cooperation) are observable across all family and friendship structures. By finding the same positive behaviors in visually diverse contexts, children learn that relationship strength comes from internal qualities, not external appearance.

### Estimated Play Time
10–14 minutes (6 scenes, approximately 1.5–2.5 minutes per scene depending on difficulty)

### Continuity Note
This game builds on Lesson 4’s teaching about diversity by making caring behaviors visually searchable across different relationship structures. The hidden-object format requires close observation, reinforcing that the same positive qualities exist in all relationships regardless of appearance. It prepares for Game 4B (applying inclusion through choices) by first establishing visual literacy around diverse relationships. The detective framing treats diversity observation as science—identifying patterns across varied contexts.

### Continuity Note
This game completes Unit 7 by moving from understanding diversity (Game 4A found caring behaviors) to actively practicing inclusion through choices (Game 4B requires thoughtful responses). The point-and-click adventure format gives agency—players see the direct consequences of inclusive versus exclusive choices. It synthesizes all lessons: families as teams (Lesson 1), friendship skills (Lesson 2), problem-solving (Lesson 3), and now applying all these skills across diverse relationships (Lesson 4). The bridge metaphor makes abstract inclusion concrete and visual.

## How Lesson 4 Fits into the Full Learning Arc

Lesson 4 concludes **Unit 7: Family and Friendship Dynamics** by transforming understanding into inclusive action. Earlier lessons guided children to see families as cooperative teams (Lesson 1), friendships as relationships built on kindness and trust (Lesson 2), and conflicts as opportunities for joint problem-solving (Lesson 3). Lesson 4 widens this circle of understanding—teaching that love, respect, and support exist across *many different forms* of family and friendship.  

Through *Diversity Detective*, children observe caring behaviors across diverse contexts, learning to recognize sameness beneath difference. Through *Inclusion Bridge Builder*, they practice inclusive choices that actively create belonging. Together, these games move learning from awareness to agency: inclusion is not just seeing diversity—it’s *doing* inclusion.  

- **Lesson 1 → Lesson 4 progression:** From “family as team” → “friendship as skill” → “cooperation through problem-solving” → “diversity as shared strength.”  
- The emphasis shifts from understanding roles to understanding *relationships across difference*, integrating empathy, curiosity, and respect into real-world behaviors.  

> 🧠 **Learning Arc Summary:** Families as Teams → Friendships as Cooperation → Problem-Solving as Trust → Inclusion as Action.  
> This final lesson anchors the unit’s message: relationship strength comes not from sameness but from how we treat one another. By observing and practicing inclusion, students internalize the psychological literacy that care and respect are universal foundations of belonging—core to both self-efficacy and social resilience.
