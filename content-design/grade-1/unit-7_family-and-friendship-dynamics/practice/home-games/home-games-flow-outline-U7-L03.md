> Jump to: [Setup](#setup) · [Play](#play) · [Scoring](#scoring) · [Win Condition](#win-condition) · [Continuity Note](#continuity-note)

### Learning Objective
Students will identify strategies for working through conflicts (listening to all perspectives, compromising, taking turns, asking for help) and recognize that problem-solving strengthens relationships.

### Game File Name & Format
`hg-07.03-01.html` — Maze Game (navigate to solutions, avoid dead ends)

### Game Purpose
This game teaches that conflict resolution requires strategic navigation through choices. By experiencing dead ends (unproductive patterns) and successful paths (productive problem-solving), children learn that conflicts have solvable routes and that certain strategies consistently lead to positive outcomes.

### Estimated Play Time
10–13 minutes (6 mazes, approximately 1.5–2 minutes per maze including dead end retries)

---

### Setup
**Opening Screen:**  
- Title: "Conflict Resolution Maze"  
- Visual: Simple maze outline with "Conflict" at start (storm cloud) and "Solution" at end (sunshine)  
- Two cartoon characters (friends in conflict) standing at maze entrance  
- Introduction text: "When friends disagree, they need to find the path to a solution! Choose the right strategies to guide friends through conflicts."  
- Button: "Start Solving!"  

**Tutorial Maze (30 seconds):**  
Conflict: "Two friends both want the same swing."  
Maze: Simple 2-choice path  
- Left path: "Grab swing and push friend away" → DEAD END (wall blocks, sad faces)  
- Right path: "Take turns—5 minutes each" → SUCCESS (path opens, happy faces)  
Player taps right path → characters walk through → reach sunshine "Solution" zone  
Text: "Great! Taking turns solved the problem. Now let's try harder conflicts!"  

---

### Play
**Core Gameplay (6 Mazes, increasing complexity):**  
Each maze represents one conflict scenario. Player must navigate characters through by choosing correct problem-solving strategy paths.

#### MAZE 1: The Toy Argument (2 paths, simple fork)
Conflict Starting Point: "Maya and Jordan both grabbed the same toy car. They're both holding it and saying 'Mine!'"  
Visual: Two kids pulling toy, angry expressions  
Path Choices:  
- Path A: "Keep pulling and yelling" → DEAD END (toy breaks, both cry)  
- Path B: "Stop and listen to each other" → PATH CONTINUES  
After Path B, second fork:  
- Path C: "Take turns playing with it" → SOLUTION (sunshine, both happy)  
- Path D: "Ask parent to decide who gets it" → Also acceptable SOLUTION  
Completion: Characters reach solution zone, shake hands  
Feedback: "You found the path! Listening first, then finding a fair solution worked!"

#### MAZE 2: The Game Rules Disagreement (3 paths, two decision points)
Conflict: "Two friends can't agree on the rules of a game. One says jump two spaces, other says jump one."  
Path Choices (First fork):  
- Path A: "Insist your rules are right and refuse to play" → DEAD END (both storm off)  
- Path B: "Listen to what each person thinks the rules are" → PATH CONTINUES  
- Path C: "Flip a coin to decide" → PATH CONTINUES (acceptable shortcut)  
After Path B, second fork:  
- Path D: "Agree to try one rule this game, the other rule next game" → SOLUTION (compromise)  
- Path E: "Look up the official rules together" → Also SOLUTION (cooperation)  
Completion: Both friends playing happily  
Feedback: "You discovered: There can be more than one good path to a solution! Compromise OR research both work!"

#### MAZE 3: The Hurt Feelings Maze (4 paths, complex)
Conflict: "Sam said something that hurt Riley's feelings. Riley is upset and thinking about not being friends anymore."  
Path Choices (First fork):  
- Path A: "Stop being friends without saying anything" → DEAD END (both alone and sad)  
- Path B: "Tell Sam how you feel" → PATH CONTINUES  
- Path C: "Ask a teacher for help explaining feelings" → PATH CONTINUES (alternative route)  
After Path B, second fork:  
- Path D: "Listen to Sam's side—did they mean to hurt feelings?" → PATH CONTINUES  
- Path E: "Demand an apology immediately" → SLOW PATH (works but takes longer)  
After Path D, final fork:  
- Path F: "Accept Sam's apology and move forward" → SOLUTION (friends hugging)  
- Path G: "Sam wasn't sorry, so take a break from friendship for now" → DIFFERENT SOLUTION (sad but acceptable)  
Completion: Either resolution reached  
Feedback: "You found a solution path! Talking about feelings + listening helps fix hurt feelings. Sometimes friendships need breaks—that's okay too."

#### MAZE 4: The Family Chore Conflict (multiple paths, 3 decision points)
Conflict: "You and your sibling both don't want to clean the playroom. Parent said you must work it out."  
Path Choices (First fork):  
- Path A: "Refuse to clean and argue" → DEAD END (parent gets upset, more consequences)  
- Path B: "Talk about why you both don't want to do it" → PATH CONTINUES  
- Path C: "Immediately ask parent to decide" → MEDIUM PATH (works but doesn't teach problem-solving)  
After Path B, second fork:  
- Path D: "Suggest splitting the room in half" → PATH CONTINUES (fair division)  
- Path E: "Suggest doing it together with music on" → PATH CONTINUES (cooperation)  
After Path D or E, final fork:  
- Path F: "Start cleaning with agreed plan" → SOLUTION (clean room, both feel accomplished)  
- Path G: "Make it a game/race" → ALSO SOLUTION (fun approach)  
Completion: Clean room, sibling high-five  
Feedback: "You discovered: Working together makes hard tasks easier and more fun! Problem-solving means finding ways everyone can handle it."

#### MAZE 5: The Group Project Disagreement (complex, 4 decision points)
Conflict: "Four kids working on project. Two want to draw, one wants to build, one wants to write. Everyone thinks their idea is best. No one is listening."  
Path Choices (First fork—this is CRITICAL):  
- Path A: "Let loudest person decide" → SLOW PATH (works but unfair, resentment grows)  
- Path B: "Everyone talks at once trying to convince others" → DEAD END (chaos, no progress)  
- Path C: "STOP. Everyone take a breath and calm down" → PATH CONTINUES (essential first step)  
After Path C, second fork:  
- Path D: "Let each person explain their idea without interrupting" → PATH CONTINUES (listening)  
- Path E: "Vote on which idea to use" → MEDIUM PATH (works but excludes ideas)  
After Path D, third fork:  
- Path F: "Pick the best parts from ALL ideas and combine them" → PATH CONTINUES (synthesis)  
- Path G: "Rotate who leads each part" → ALSO CONTINUES (fair leadership)  
After Path F, final fork:  
- Path H: "Assign tasks based on who's good at what (drawer draws, builder builds, writer writes)" → SOLUTION (amazing project, everyone proud)  
- Path I: "Everyone does everything together" → SLOWER SOLUTION (takes longer but very cooperative)  
Completion: Spectacular project displayed, all four kids celebrating  
Feedback: "You navigated a complex conflict! Multiple friendship skills worked together: Stopping to calm down + Listening + Respecting all ideas + Cooperating = Best results!"

#### MAZE 6: Challenge Maze - The Escalated Conflict (5 decision points, many dead ends)
Conflict: "Two best friends had a huge fight yesterday. They haven't talked since. Both are angry and hurt. Other friends are taking sides. The conflict is spreading."  
Visual: Dark storm clouds, multiple kids involved, complex maze with many paths  
Path Choices (First fork—CRITICAL):  
- Path A: "Avoid each other forever" → DEAD END (friendship ends, both sad long-term)  
- Path B: "Text mean things to make them feel as bad as you do" → DEAD END (conflict gets worse)  
- Path C: "Ask a trusted adult/teacher/parent for help" → PATH CONTINUES (smart first step)  
- Path D: "Take a day to cool down, then try talking" → ALSO PATH CONTINUES (mature choice)  
After Path C or D, second fork:  
- Path E: "Meet in private to talk" → PATH CONTINUES (good environment)  
- Path F: "Try talking in front of all friends who took sides" → DEAD END (too public, pressure makes it worse)  
After Path E, third fork:  
- Path G: "Both explain what made them upset" → PATH CONTINUES (sharing perspectives)  
- Path H: "Demand the other person apologize first" → DEAD END (standoff, no progress)  
After Path G, fourth fork:  
- Path I: "Really listen to friend's side—understand their feelings" → PATH CONTINUES (empathy)  
- Path J: "Argue about who was more wrong" → DEAD END (blame game)  
After Path I, final fork:  
- Path K: "Both apologize for their part + agree to move forward" → BEST SOLUTION (friendship stronger than before, learned from conflict)  
- Path L: "Agree to disagree but stay friends" → ACCEPTABLE SOLUTION (not perfect but maintained friendship)  
- Path M: "Decide friendship needs a break for now" → REALISTIC SOLUTION (sad but sometimes necessary)  
Completion: Any of K, L, or M reached  
Feedback: "You navigated the hardest conflict! Big fights need: Cooling down + Getting help + Listening + Understanding + Forgiveness. Sometimes even best efforts mean friendships change—and that's part of life too. What matters is that you TRIED to solve it respectfully."

### Continuity Note
This game builds on Lesson 3's teaching that conflicts have solvable patterns by transforming problem-solving into spatial navigation. The maze mechanic makes abstract conflict strategies concrete and visible—players literally see which choices lead to dead ends versus solutions. It prepares for Game 3B (simulation-based conflict variables) by first establishing the strategic decision-making involved. The multiple valid solution paths reinforce that conflict resolution is flexible, not formulaic, building adaptive thinking.

## Home Game 3B – Peace Builder Simulation
> Jump to: [Setup](#setup-1) · [Play](#play-1) · [Scoring](#scoring-1) · [Win Condition](#win-condition-1) · [Continuity Note](#continuity-note-1)

### Learning Objective
Students will demonstrate conflict resolution by practicing specific strategies and distinguish between productive problem-solving and unproductive patterns.

### Game File Name & Format
`hg-07.03-02.html` — Simulation/Sandbox (adjust variables, observe outcomes)

### Game Purpose
This game teaches that conflict outcomes are influenced by measurable, adjustable variables rather than random chance. By experimenting with different combinations of problem-solving factors, children learn that they have control over conflict resolution and can predict which approaches lead to positive versus negative outcomes.

### Estimated Play Time
10–14 minutes (5 scenarios, approximately 2–3 minutes per scenario allowing for multiple experiments)

---

### Setup
**Opening Screen:**  
- Title: "Peace Builder Simulation"  
- Visual: Laboratory setting with two cartoon characters (in conflict) on screen, surrounded by control panels  
- Character avatar: Scientist child with goggles holding clipboard  
- Introduction text: "Welcome to the Peace Lab! Scientists study how conflicts get solved. You'll adjust different variables (like anger and listening) and see what happens to the friendship!"  
- Display shows:  
  - Two characters (Alex and Jordan) with neutral expressions  
  - Relationship meter (currently at 50% - "Medium Friendship")  
  - Three variable sliders (currently at middle position)  
- Button: "Start Experimenting!"  

**Tutorial (30 seconds):**  
Scientist avatar: "Let's run your first experiment! Alex and Jordan had a disagreement about a game."  
Experiment 1: High Anger, Low Listening  
- Anger slider shown: "Move this to HIGH"  
- Listening slider shown: "Move this to LOW"  
- Button: "Run Simulation"  
Result: Characters yell, turn away, relationship meter drops to 20% (red), sad faces  
Text: "When anger is high and listening is low, conflicts get WORSE!"  
Experiment 2: Low Anger, High Listening  
- Adjust sliders opposite way  
- "Run Simulation"  
Result: Characters talk calmly, nod, relationship meter rises to 80% (green), happy faces  
Text: "When anger is low and listening is high, conflicts get SOLVED! Now you try combinations yourself!"  

---

### Play
**Core Gameplay (5 Conflict Scenarios, experimental testing):**  
Each scenario presents a conflict between two characters. Player manipulates 3–4 variables to discover which combinations lead to positive outcomes.

#### SCENARIO 1: The Borrowed Toy Conflict
Setup: "Casey lent Morgan a special toy. Morgan accidentally broke it. Casey is upset."  
Characters: Casey (upset) and Morgan (worried)  
Starting Relationship Meter: 70% (good friends before conflict)  

**Variables to Adjust (3 sliders):**  
- Casey's Anger Level: Low ← → Medium ← → High  
- Morgan's Apology Quality: None ← → Half-hearted ← → Sincere  
- Casey's Willingness to Forgive: Low ← → Medium ← → High  

**Player Experiment:**  
Adjust sliders to different positions  
Tap "Run Simulation"  
Observe animated outcome + relationship meter change  

**Sample Outcomes:**  
- High Anger + No Apology + Low Forgiveness: Characters argue, Morgan leaves angry, Meter drops to 30% (orange/red), "Friendship damaged"  
- Medium Anger + Sincere Apology + Low Forgiveness: Characters talk, still tense, Meter stays ~65% (yellow), "Friendship strained but surviving"  
- Low Anger + Sincere Apology + High Forgiveness: Morgan apologizes, Casey accepts, they hug, Morgan offers to replace toy, Meter rises to 85% (green), "Friendship strengthened!"  
- Low Anger + Half-hearted Apology + High Forgiveness: Meter goes to 75%, "Friendship okay but could be better with sincere apology"  

**Learning Objective:** Casey's anger management + Morgan's sincere apology + Casey's forgiveness = BEST outcome  
Feedback After 3+ Experiments: "You discovered: When accidents happen, THREE things help: (1) Managing anger, (2) Sincere apologies, (3) Willingness to forgive. Test more combinations!"

#### SCENARIO 2: The Game Rule Disagreement
Setup: "Taylor and Jamie can't agree on game rules. Both think they're right."  
Starting Relationship Meter: 75%  

**Variables (3 sliders):**  
- Taylor's Listening Level: Low ← → Medium ← → High  
- Jamie's Listening Level: Low ← → Medium ← → High  
- Willingness to Compromise: Both Refuse ← → One Willing ← → Both Willing  

**Sample Outcomes:**  
- Both Low Listening + Both Refuse: Argument escalates, both storm off, Meter drops to 40%, "Conflict unresolved"  
- Both High Listening + One Willing to Compromise: They find middle ground, Meter rises to 85%, "Good problem-solving!"  
- Both High Listening + Both Willing to Compromise: They create combined rules together, Meter jumps to 95%, "Excellent teamwork!"  
- One High, One Low Listening + Both Willing: Asymmetric, Meter ~70%, "Better than fighting but one person dominated"  

**Learning Objective:** BOTH listening + BOTH compromising = strongest outcome  
Feedback: "You discovered: It takes BOTH people listening and compromising to solve conflicts best. If only one person tries, it helps a little—but both trying works best!"

#### SCENARIO 3: The Hurt Feelings Conflict
Setup: "Riley said something that hurt Sam's feelings. Sam is very upset. Riley didn't realize it was hurtful."  
Starting Relationship Meter: 80% (close friends)  

**Variables (4 sliders):**  
- Sam's Communication: Stays Silent ← → Hints ← → Directly Says Feelings  
- Riley's Awareness: Unaware ← → Senses Something ← → Fully Aware  
- Riley's Response: Defensive ← → Confused ← → Apologetic  
- Time to Resolve: Immediate ← → Few Hours ← → Next Day  

**Sample Outcomes:**  
- Silent + Unaware + Defensive + Next Day: Sam bottles feelings, Riley never learns, Meter slowly drops to 55%, "Silent resentment builds"  
- Directly Says + Fully Aware + Apologetic + Immediate: Open communication, sincere apology, quick healing, Meter rises to 90%, "Honesty strengthened friendship!"  
- Hints + Senses Something + Confused + Few Hours: Partial understanding, awkward but eventually resolved, Meter ~75%, "Better than silence but direct is clearer"  
- Directly Says + Fully Aware + Defensive + Immediate: Sam honest but Riley defensive, conflict escalates before eventual resolution, Meter dips to 65% then slowly recovers  

**Learning Objective:** Direct communication + awareness + sincere apology + quick response = BEST healing  
Feedback: "You discovered: Hurt feelings heal best when: (1) The hurt person speaks up clearly, (2) The other person really listens and understands, (3) A sincere apology happens quickly. Silence and defensiveness make things worse!"

#### SCENARIO 4: The Family Chore Conflict
Setup: "Two siblings must clean their shared room. Neither wants to do it. Parent says work it out or no screen time."  
Starting Relationship Meter: 60% (siblings—ups and downs)  

**Variables (4 sliders):**  
- Fairness of Task Division: One Does All ← → Mostly Fair ← → Perfectly Equal  
- Attitude During Work: Complaining ← → Neutral ← → Positive/Fun  
- Speed of Starting: Delay/Argue ← → Some Delay ← → Start Right Away  
- Adult Involvement: Not Needed ← → Minimal Check-in ← → Constant Supervision  

**Sample Outcomes:**  
- One Does All + Complaining + Delay + Constant Supervision: Unfair, resentful, forced, Meter drops to 35%, "Resentment builds, parent had to force it"  
- Perfectly Equal + Positive + Start Right Away + Not Needed: Fair split, made it fun, cooperative, Meter rises to 80%, "Great teamwork! Parent proud!"  
- Mostly Fair + Neutral + Some Delay + Minimal Check-in: Adequate solution, job gets done without too much conflict, Meter ~65%, "Acceptable but could be better"  
- Perfectly Equal + Positive + Start Right Away + Not Needed: Turn chore into game/race, both enjoy it, finish fast, Meter jumps to 85%, "Best siblings!"  

**Learning Objective:** Equal division + positive attitude + quick start + independence = strongest cooperation  
Feedback: "You discovered: Family teamwork works best when tasks are divided fairly AND people make it fun! Starting quickly without arguing helps too. When siblings solve problems themselves (without parent forcing), the relationship gets stronger!"

#### SCENARIO 5: Complex Challenge - The Group Project Crisis
Setup: "Four kids (Devon, Sage, River, Parker) have 2 days until group project due. Everyone's ideas conflict. Frustration is high. Project is nowhere near done."  
Starting Relationship Meter: Group at 55% (stressed, tense)  

**Variables (5 sliders - more complex):**  
- Group Listening Quality: No One Listens ← → Some Listen ← → Everyone Listens  
- Leader Emergence: No Leader (Chaos) ← → Self-Appointed Leader ← → Agreed-Upon Leader  
- Idea Integration: Use Only One Idea ← → Combine Some ← → Integrate All Ideas  
- Time Management: No Plan ← → Loose Plan ← → Clear Timeline  
- Mutual Respect: Blame/Criticize ← → Tolerate ← → Value Everyone  

**Sample Outcomes:**  
- No One Listens + No Leader + One Idea + No Plan + Blame: Total chaos, project fails, friendships damaged, Meter drops to 20%, "Group fell apart"  
- Some Listen + Self-Appointed Leader + Some Combined + Loose Plan + Tolerate: Project gets done but tension remains, Meter ~60%, "Survived but not thriving"  
- Everyone Listens + Agreed Leader + Integrate All + Clear Timeline + Value Everyone: Spectacular project, everyone contributes strengths, finish early, celebrate, Meter soars to 95%, "Dream team!"  
- Everyone Listens + Agreed Leader + Integrate All + Clear Timeline + Tolerate: Great project but some lingering stress from earlier tension, Meter ~85%, "Successful but could celebrate more"  

**Learning Objective:** All 5 variables at optimal levels = best group outcome. Missing even one variable lowers success.  
Feedback: "You discovered: Complex group conflicts need MULTIPLE factors working together: Listening + Leadership + Inclusion + Planning + Respect. When all five are strong, groups create amazing results AND friendships grow. If even one is weak, the whole group suffers!"

### Win Condition
**Completion:** Player conducts experiments across all 5 conflict scenarios, discovering at least one positive outcome for each situation.

**Victory Screen:**  
- Title: "You're a Peace Scientist!"  
- Visual: Laboratory with all 5 scenarios displayed as "completed experiments," characters from all scenarios celebrating together  
- Scientist avatar with clipboard: "Experiment Complete! You discovered the science of peace-building!"  
- Points earned and achievement badge displayed  
- Key Scientific Discoveries Summary:  
  - "🔬 Experiment 1: Sincere apologies + forgiveness heal accidents"  
  - "🔬 Experiment 2: Both people compromising works better than just one"  
  - "🔬 Experiment 3: Direct communication + quick apologies solve hurt feelings"  
  - "🔬 Experiment 4: Fair division + positive attitudes make teamwork strong"  
  - "🔬 Experiment 5: Complex problems need multiple factors working together"  
- Total Experiments Run: XX  
- Optimal Outcomes Discovered: X/5  
- Text: "You discovered that conflict resolution follows scientific patterns! When you adjust variables like anger, listening, compromise, and respect, you get predictable results. LOW anger + HIGH listening + HIGH willingness to solve = STRONG friendships. HIGH anger + LOW listening + refusal to compromise = DAMAGED friendships. This means YOU have power in conflicts—by controlling how YOU respond (your variables), you can guide conflicts toward solutions. That's the science of peace-building!"  
- Scientist's Final Note: "Real conflicts are messy and don't have perfect sliders—but the PRINCIPLES are the same. Managing your emotions, listening well, and compromising really do make conflicts better. You tested it yourself!"

### Continuity Note
This game completes Lesson 3 by transforming conflict resolution from abstract strategies into manipulable variables that produce observable outcomes. The simulation format reinforces that conflict patterns are predictable and controllable, not random or emotional chaos. It prepares for Lesson 4 by demonstrating that these same conflict resolution principles work across all relationship types (friendships, families, groups) regardless of differences, since the underlying psychology is universal.

## How Lesson 3 Fits into the Full Learning Arc

Lesson 3 represents the **turning point** of Unit 7—where harmony gives way to challenge and students learn that strong relationships depend not on the absence of conflict, but on the ability to solve it cooperatively. The two home games translate this principle into active discovery: *Conflict Resolution Maze* transforms emotional complexity into visible decision paths, while *Peace Builder Simulation* turns those same dynamics into measurable, cause-and-effect experiments. Both experiences equip children with the understanding that relationships can be repaired through thoughtful action, not luck or avoidance.

- **Lesson 1:** Introduced families as the child’s first social system where teamwork and shared responsibility are learned.  
- **Lesson 2:** Extended teamwork into friendships, teaching that trust, fairness, and kindness sustain cooperation.  
- **Lesson 3 (this lesson):** Normalizes disagreement as a natural part of connection and develops strategic, evidence-based approaches to resolving it.  
- **Lesson 4:** Builds outward from these skills toward inclusivity and empathy, celebrating diversity in how families and friendships take shape.

> 🧭 **Learning Arc Summary:** Team as Foundation → Friendship as Skill → Conflict as Growth → Diversity as Connection.  
> Through this arc, children evolve from cooperation within harmony to cooperation through challenge—learning that problem-solving and empathy are what make relationships resilient, adaptable, and enduring.
