## In-Class-Game 7A – Family Team Builder

## Lesson 1: Families Are Our First Teams

**LESSON LINK & LEARNING OBJECTIVE**

Unit 7, Lesson 1: Families Are Our First Teams Learning Objective: Students will understand that families function as teams in which members have different roles and responsibilities, and that families support one another to help the group function well-regardless of what the family looks like.

**GAME FILE NAME: icg-07.01-game01.html**

**GAME TITLE: Family Team Builder**

**GAME FORMAT** Drag-and-Drop Lab (adapted as Role Assignment Challenge) This format allows students to actively construct family systems by assigning roles to family members, then observing the outcome. It emphasizes the science of social systems-how different roles combine to create a functioning team.

**PURPOSE:** Students practice identifying and assigning different family roles and responsibilities to create a functioning family team. They observe that when all roles are filled (cooking, cleaning, caring, playing, helping), the family system works well. This reinforces the concept that families are interdependent systems where different contributions matter.

**Position in Lesson Arc**: During PRACTICE B (25-34m). After video exploration, MindMaster quiz, guided discussion, and psychology test; before reflection.

**Pedagogical Justification**: The game is strategically placed after students have:

- Watched families working together (video)
- Answered conceptual questions about family teamwork (MindMaster quiz)
- Discussed roles and responsibilities explicitly (guided discussion)
- Observed and identified roles in scenarios (psychology test)

This placement allows the game to serve as applied practice where students actively construct family systems by assigning roles-moving from passive observation and identification to active construction. The hands-on drag-and-drop mechanic reinforces that families are interdependent systems where different contributions combine to create functioning teams. Coming before reflection, it provides concrete experiential material for students to reflect upon.

**SETUP Opening Screen:**

• Title: "Family Team Builder"

• Cartoon background showing a house with empty rooms (kitchen, living room, bedroom, yard)

• Avatar: A friendly cartoon "Family Coach" character (gender-neutral, wearing a whistle) appears and says: "Welcome, Team Builder! Every family is a team. Let's see how families work when everyone has a job to do!"

• Instructions appear: "You'll meet different families. Your job: Give each family member a role. Then watch what happens when the family team works together!"

• Button: "Start Building" (Clicker Button 5 to start)

Student sees:

A cartoon family on the left side (characters vary by round-different sizes, structures, ethnicities)

Empty "role cards" on the right side showing different family jobs (cooking, cleaning, playing with kids, fixing things, caring for pets, helping with homework)

Bottom of screen: "Use your clicker to assign roles!"

**PLAY**

Round 1: Small Family (3 members - 1 parent, 2 kids) Step 1: Screen displays the family members (Parent, Child 1, Child 2) standing in a row Step 2: First family member highlighted (Parent). Six role options appear numbered 1-6:

1\. Cook meals

2\. Clean house

3\. Play with kids

4\. Fix things

5\. Care for pets

6\. Help with homework Step 3:

Student clicks button 1-6 to assign role to Parent Step 4: Assigned role appears as a small icon next to the Parent character Step 5: Next family member highlighted (Child 1). Remaining role options appear (5 roles left) Step 6: Student assigns role using clicker buttons 1-5 Step 7: Final family member highlighted (Child 2). Remaining roles appear Step 8: Student assigns final role Step 9: Animation plays: Family members move to different areas of the house performing their roles simultaneously Step 10: Outcome screen: "Look! This family team is working! Everyone has a job. The family is happy and healthy." Step 11: Feedback: "You helped this family become a strong team by giving everyone a role."

Round 2: Larger Family (5 members - 2 parents, 2 kids, 1 grandparent) Step 1: New family appears (different visual style/ethnicity from Round 1) Step 2: Same process-each family member gets assigned a role from the available options Step 3: Now there are MORE family members than roles, so students must choose which roles are most important OR some members might share a role Step 4: If student assigns roles thoughtfully (covering key needs), animation shows family working well Step 5: Outcome: "Great thinking! In bigger families, sometimes people share jobs or take turns. The team still works!"

Round 3: Different Family Structure (Single parent + 3 kids) Step 1: New family structure appears Step 2: Challenge presented: "This parent has a lot to do! How can the kids help make this family team work?" Step 3: Student assigns roles-parent will need to have multiple roles OR kids take on more helping roles Step 4: If student distributes roles so everyone contributes, animation shows family succeeding Step 5: Outcome: "Excellent! Even when families look different, teamwork makes them strong. Everyone helped!"

Round 4: Extended Family (Grandparents, parents, kids all living together) Step 1: New large family with multiple generations appears Step 2: Students assign roles across all family members Step 3: Animation shows multigenerational cooperation Step 4: Outcome: "Amazing! This family has lots of people helping in different ways. That's teamwork!"

Challenge Round (Optional - if time): Step 1: Mixed challenge-student sees 3 different families side by side Step 2: Must quickly assign at least 3 roles to each family to make all three families function Step 3: Timer element (not stressful-shows "time to build teams") Step 4: Outcome: "You built THREE strong family teams! You understand how families work as systems!"

**SCORING Points System:**

• Role Assignment: 10 points for each role appropriately assigned

• Complete Team: 50 bonus points when all family members have roles

• System Success: 100 points when the family animation shows everyone working together

• Observation Bonus: After each round, student answers 1 quick observation question using clicker:

◦ "Did this family work well as a team?" (Button 1 = Yes, Button 2 = No)

◦ Correct answer = 25 bonus points

Total possible per round: ~200 points Total possible for 4 rounds: ~800 points

Progress Indicator:

• Visual "Team Strength Meter" fills up as students complete rounds

• Meter has 4 segments (one per family)

• When meter is full: "You're a Family Team Expert!"

NO competitive leaderboard-individual progress celebrated

**SCORING DISPLAY**

• Points appear in corner after each role assignment ("+10 points!")

• Running total visible but not prominent

• Focus on the family team building successfully, not the score

• After each round: "Family Team Built! +100 points"

**WIN CONDITION Student completes all 4 family-building rounds successfully by:**

1\. Assigning roles to all family members in each scenario

2\. Observing the family team working together

3\. Answering observation questions correctly (at least 3 out of 4)

**Success Screen:**

• "Congratulations, Team Builder! You learned that families are teams where everyone has different jobs and responsibilities!"

• Visual: All 4 families appear together on screen, all working happily

• Key Learning Reinforced: "Remember: Families look different, but they all work as teams when members help each other!"

• Badge Earned: "Family Team Expert" badge appears

• Button: "Return to Class" (Button 5) - links back to lesson page

CONTINUITY NOTE This game serves as the foundation for Unit 7 by establishing families as observable social systems with roles and interdependence. It connects forward to:

• Lesson 2: Students will see friendships as another kind of "team" with different roles (the listener, the helper, the funny one)

• Lesson 3: When family/friend teams have conflicts, they need problem-solving strategies

• Lesson 4: The game already shows diverse family structures, preparing students to appreciate that all family forms can be strong teams

Visual continuity: The "Family Coach" character could reappear in Lesson 2's game as a "Friendship Coach" to emphasize the parallel between family teams and friendship teams.

## In-Class-Game 7B – Friendship Builder 

## Lesson 2: What Makes a Good Friend

### Lesson Link & Learning Objective

Students will identify the key qualities that make friendships strong (kindness, listening, trust, sharing, taking turns, respect) and will understand that being a good friend is a learner skill that improves with practice.

### Game File Name: ****icg-07.02-game01.html****

### **Game Title: **Friendship Builder Challenge****

### **Game Format**: **Format:** Build the Tower (Co-operative & Progressive)

****Format Selection Rationale**:** This format has **0 uses** in Round 1, making it a priority selection for increasing format variety. The Build the Tower mechanic is pedagogically ideal for Lesson 2 because it makes friendship-building concrete and observable: each correct identification of a friendship skill "builds" the friendship higher, visually representing that friendships are constructed through accumulated positive behaviors. The progressive stacking mechanic reinforces that friendship is not innate but built through repeated practice of specific skills-aligning perfectly with the lesson's core principle that "being a good friend is a skill that improves with practice." The cooperative classroom element (whole class builds one tower together) mirrors the collaborative nature of friendship itself, while the visible cause-effect relationship (correct answer = tower grows; incorrect = tower wobbles) demonstrates that friendship strength depends on consistent application of core qualities.

### **Purpose**: Students practice identifying the six friendship skills (kindness, listening, trust, sharing, taking turns, respect) by observing realistic scenarios and determining which skill is being demonstrated. Each correct class response adds a "friendship block" to a growing tower, visually reinforcing that friendships are built through accumulated positive behaviors

### **Position in Lesson Arc**: PRACTICE D (25-35 minutes into 45-minute lesson)  

**Pedagogical Justification:** The game is positioned after students have:

- Identified good vs. not-good friend behaviors (psychology test via MindMaster)
- Watched friendship skills modeled (video)
- Learned the six specific friendship skills explicitly (guided discussion)
- Practiced applying skills in scenarios (role-play)

This placement leverages the game as skill consolidation where students must now discriminate between similar-looking behaviors and match them to the correct friendship skill category. Coming after explicit instruction and role-play but before reflection, the game provides pattern recognition practice that bridges learning to metacognitive awareness-students see the cumulative effect of their knowledge (tower height) before discussing what they've learned.

### Setup

**Opening Screen:**

- Background: Playground scene with blue sky, grass, sandbox, swings
- Center: Empty platform with ground marker reading "Friendship Tower Foundation"
- Top right: Score display showing "Blocks Earned: 0 / 12"
- Avatar: "Buddy the Builder" - a friendly cartoon bear wearing a construction hat and tool belt, standing to the left of the platform
- Buddy speaks in speech bubble: "Let's build a Friendship Tower! Every time we spot a friendship skill, we add a block. Can we build it 12 blocks tall?"

**First Interaction:**

- Button appears center-screen: "Start Building" (Button 5 to start)
- Students click Button 5
- Transition to Round 1

### Play

**Game Structure:** 12 rounds, each presenting a friendship scenario

**Round Sequence (repeated 12 times):**

**Step 1: Scenario Presentation**

- Screen shows animated mini-scene (3-5 seconds, looping)
- Buddy narrates the scenario aloud
- Example scenarios:

**Round 1:** Two children at art table. Child A gives Child B a crayon. Child B smiles.  
Buddy: "Maya gives her crayon to Sam when Sam needs one. Which friendship skill is this?"

**Round 2:** Two children on swings. Child A is talking. Child B faces them, nodding.  
Buddy: "Jordan listens while Alex tells a story about their pet. Which friendship skill?"

**Round 3:** Child A whispers to Child B. Child B nods and doesn't tell others.  
Buddy: "Casey keeps a secret that Morgan shared. Which friendship skill?"

**Round 4:** Two children want the same toy. Child A says "You go first."  
Buddy: "Riley lets Taylor play with the toy first. Which friendship skill?"

**Round 5:** Child A trips and drops books. Child B stops and helps pick them up.  
Buddy: "Avery helps when Jamie drops their books. Which friendship skill?"

**Round 6:** Two children building blocks together. They point and discuss ideas.  
Buddy: "Both friends share ideas and listen to each other. Which friendship skill?"

**Round 7:** Child A says "Good job!" to Child B after Child B finishes puzzle.  
Buddy: "Pat says something nice when Quinn solves the puzzle. Which friendship skill?"

**Round 8:** Two children play catch. They take turns throwing and catching.  
Buddy: "Both friends get chances to throw. Which friendship skill?"

**Round 9:** Child A looks sad. Child B sits next to them and asks "Are you okay?"  
Buddy: "Bailey notices when Cameron seems upset and asks about it. Which friendship skill?"

**Round 10:** Child A promises to play tomorrow. Next scene shows them playing together.  
Buddy: "Drew said they'd play, and they did! Which friendship skill?"

**Round 11:** Two children disagree about game rules. They talk it out calmly.  
Buddy: "They have different ideas but stay kind while figuring it out. Which friendship skill?"

**Round 12:** Child A includes Child B who was sitting alone at lunch.  
Buddy: "Skylar invites Harper to sit together. Which friendship skill?"

**Step 2: Answer Options Appear**

  - Button 2: Listening
  - Button 3: Trust
  - Button 4: Sharing
  - Button 5: Taking Turns
  - Button 6: Respect
- All students select their answer using clicker (Buttons 1-6)

**Step 3: Class Response Processing**

- App records all responses
- Majority answer is selected as class answer
- (If tie, app randomly selects from tied options)

**Step 4: Feedback**

**If Correct:**

- Green checkmark appears
- Buddy: "Yes! That's \[skill name\]! This builds friendship."
- Animation: A colorful block rises from bottom of screen and stacks on tower platform
- Block labeled with skill name (e.g., "Kindness," "Listening")
- Tower grows by one block
- Sound: Cheerful "ding" and building sound effect
- Score updates: "Blocks Earned: \[X\] / 12"

**If Incorrect:**

- Yellow caution symbol appears (not X - stays encouraging)
- Buddy: "Hmm, let's think. That was actually \[correct skill\]. Let's try the next one!"
- Animation: Tower wobbles slightly but stays standing
- No block added
- Sound: Gentle "wobble" sound (not negative buzzer)
- Score stays same

**Step 5: Brief Reinforcement**

- Buddy adds one teaching sentence:
  - "Kindness means being nice with words and actions."
  - "Listening means paying attention when friends talk."
  - "Trust means keeping promises and secrets safe."
  - "Sharing means letting friends use things too."
  - "Taking turns means everyone gets a chance."
  - "Respect means treating friends how they want to be treated."

**Step 6: Transition**

- Button appears: "Next Friend Moment" (Button 5)
- Students click to proceed to next round
- Repeat Steps 1-6 for all 12 rounds

### Scoring

**Points System:**

- Each correct answer = 1 Friendship Block added to tower
- Maximum possible score: 12 blocks (perfect tower)
- Score displayed continuously: "Blocks Earned: \[X\] / 12"

**Visual Progression:**

- Tower grows visibly with each correct answer
- Blocks stack vertically, each labeled with the skill identified
- Different colored blocks for each skill (6 colors recurring):
  - Kindness = Pink
  - Listening = Blue
  - Trust = Green
  - Sharing = Orange
  - Taking Turns = Purple
  - Respect = Yellow

**No Individual Scoring:**

- This is a class cooperative game
- All students contribute to building one shared tower
- Emphasis on collective achievement, not competition

### Win Condition

**Completion:**

- Game ends after all 12 rounds are played
- Final screen shows completed Friendship Tower (whatever height achieved)

**Outcome Screens:**

**If 10-12 Blocks:**

- Tower stands tall and proud
- Buddy: "Amazing! You built a super strong Friendship Tower! You really know the skills that make friendships work. Every time you practice these skills, your friendships get stronger-just like this tower!"
- Animation: Tower sparkles, confetti falls
- Badge appears: "Friendship Expert" with star icon

**If 7-9 Blocks:**

- Tower stands medium height
- Buddy: "Great work! You're building your friendship knowledge. The more you practice spotting these skills, the better you'll get. Friendships grow with practice!"
- Animation: Tower glows warmly
- Badge appears: "Friendship Builder" with tool icon

**If 4-6 Blocks:**

- Tower stands short but stable
- Buddy: "Good start! You're learning the friendship skills. Remember: kindness, listening, trust, sharing, taking turns, and respect. Keep practicing and you'll spot them everywhere!"
- Animation: Tower stands firm
- Badge appears: "Friendship Learner" with book icon

**If 0-3 Blocks:**

- Small foundation with few blocks

- Animation: Foundation glows
- Badge appears: "Friendship Starter" with seedling icon

**All outcomes are encouraging and growth-oriented**

**Final Button:**

- "Return to Lesson" (Button 5) - links back to lesson-07.02.html

### Continuity Note

**Builds on:** Lesson 1 taught that families work as teams with different roles. Lesson 2 expands this to friendships-another kind of team where specific behaviors (the six skills) create strong connections.

**Prepares for:** Lesson 3 will teach that when friendship teams face conflicts, they can use problem-solving strategies to work through disagreements-building on the foundation that friendships are systems maintained through skillful behaviors.

## In-Class-Game 7C – The Bridge Builder

## Lesson 3: Solving Problems Together

### Lesson Link & Learning Objective

Students will understand that disagreements and conflicts are normal parts of relationships and will learn and practice simple problem-solving strategies (listening, compromising, taking turns, asking for help) to work through conflicts respectfully.

### Game File Name: ****icg-07.03-game01.html****

### Game Title: ****The Bridge Builder****

### **Game Format: Bridge Builder (Co-operative & Progressive)**

****Format Selection Rationale**:** This format has **0 uses** in Round 1, making it a priority selection for increasing format variety. The Bridge Builder mechanic is pedagogically ideal for Lesson 3 because it creates a powerful visual metaphor: conflicts create gaps between friends, and problem-solving strategies literally bridge those gaps. Each correct identification of a problem-solving strategy extends the bridge segment by segment, making the abstract concept of "conflict resolution" concrete and observable. The progressive connection mechanic reinforces the lesson's core principle that solving problems together strengthens relationships (the bridge connects two islands, representing two people maintaining their bond). The visible cause-effect relationship (correct strategy = bridge extends; incorrect = bridge stops) demonstrates that conflicts have predictable patterns and solutions, aligning perfectly with the psychology-as-science framework that problem-solving is a learnable, systematic process rather than something mysterious or emotional.

### **Purpose**: Students practice identifying the four problem-solving strategies (listening, compromising, taking turns, asking for help) by observing realistic conflict scenarios and determining which strategy would best resolve the situation. Each correct class response adds a bridge segment, visually reinforcing that problem-solving connects people and strengthens relationships

### **Position in Lesson Arc**: PRACTICE C (20-30 minutes into 45-minute lesson)  

**Pedagogical Justification:** The game is positioned after students have:

- Watched conflict resolution modeled (video)
- Learned the four problem-solving strategies explicitly (guided discussion)
- Observed step-by-step conflict resolution process (psychology experiment with scenarios)

This placement uses the game as guided practice where students must now discriminate between different conflict types and match them to the appropriate strategy. Coming after explicit instruction and demonstration but before role-play practice, the game provides scaffolded decision-making in a safe experimental space-students can test their understanding of which strategies work for which conflicts before applying them with peers. The bridge metaphor reinforces that their growing knowledge is literally "building connections," preparing them for the hands-on role-play that follows.

### Setup

**Opening Screen:**

- Background: Two islands separated by water gap (approximately 40% of screen width)
- Left Island: "Friendship Island" - lush green island with two children standing together (avatars: diverse representation)
- Right Island: "Problem Island" - similar island with question mark sign, currently empty
- Water between islands: Clear blue, gentle waves
- Top right: Progress display showing "Bridge Segments: 0 / 10"
- Avatar: "Bridget the Builder Beaver" - friendly cartoon beaver wearing engineer's vest and hardhat, standing on left island
- Bridget speaks in speech bubble: "Oh no! A problem has separated these friends. Let's use problem-solving strategies to build a bridge back together. Can we connect all 10 segments?"

**First Interaction:**

- Button appears center-screen: "Start Building" (Button 5 to start)
- Students click Button 5
- Transition to Round 1

### Play

**Game Structure:** 10 rounds, each presenting a conflict scenario requiring a problem-solving strategy

**Round Sequence (repeated 10 times):**

**Step 1: Conflict Scenario Presentation**

- Camera zooms to show "Problem Island"
- Animated mini-scene appears (5-7 seconds, looping)
- Two children appear on Problem Island, showing the conflict
- Bridget narrates the scenario aloud
- Example scenarios:

**Round 1:** Two children both reaching for the same red swing.  
Bridget: "Both friends want to use the swing right now. What strategy would help solve this problem?"

**Round 2:** Child A is upset. Child B doesn't understand why.  
Bridget: "One friend is upset, but the other friend doesn't know what's wrong. What strategy would help?"

**Round 3:** Two children want to play different games - one wants tag, one wants hide-and-seek.  
Bridget: "These friends want to play different games. What strategy could help them both have fun?"

**Round 4:** Child A accidentally knocked over Child B's block tower. Child B is angry.  
Bridget: "One friend knocked over the other's blocks by accident. Now they're both upset. What strategy would help?"

**Round 5:** Two children both want to be team captain.  
Bridget: "Both friends want to be the leader. What strategy could make this fair?"

**Round 6:** Child A borrowed Child B's marker and lost it. Child B is frustrated.  
Bridget: "One friend lost the other's marker. They're having trouble figuring out what to do. What strategy would help?"

**Round 7:** Two children can't agree on which book to read together.  
Bridget: "These friends both want to read, but they like different books. What strategy could work?"

**Round 8:** Child A is talking, but Child B keeps interrupting.  
Bridget: "One friend wants to share something, but the other keeps interrupting. What strategy would help?"

**Round 9:** Two children both want to sit in the same spot at lunch.  
Bridget: "Both friends want the same seat. What strategy could solve this?"

**Round 10:** Child A and Child B both want to use the art supplies, but there's only one set.  
Bridget: "These friends both need the art supplies right now, but they're having trouble deciding how to share. What strategy would help?"

**Step 2: Strategy Options Appear**

- Four buttons appear on screen, numbered 1-4:
  - Button 1: Listen to each person
  - Button 2: Compromise (find middle solution)
  - Button 3: Take turns
  - Button 4: Ask a grown-up for help
- Small icons appear next to each option:
  - Button 1: Ear icon
  - Button 2: Handshake icon
  - Button 3: Clock/arrow icon
  - Button 4: Adult helper icon
- All students select their answer using clicker (Buttons 1-4)

**Step 3: Class Response Processing**

- App records all responses
- Majority answer is selected as class answer
- (If tie, app randomly selects from tied options)

**Step 4: Feedback**

**If Correct (or acceptable strategy):**

- Green checkmark appears
- Bridget: "Yes! \[Strategy name\] works here! Here's how: \[brief explanation\]"
  - Examples:
    - "Listening helps because both friends get to explain what they want."
    - "Compromising means they could read one book today, the other tomorrow."
    - "Taking turns means one person goes first now, the other goes first next time."
    - "Asking for help means a teacher can help them find a fair solution."
- Animation: A bridge segment extends from Friendship Island toward Problem Island (wooden plank with support beams)
- Segment locks into place with satisfying "click"
- Sound: Construction sound effect, cheerful "ding"
- Progress updates: "Bridge Segments: \[X\] / 10"
- If multiple strategies could work, Bridget adds: "Other strategies might work too, but this one definitely helps!"

**If Incorrect (strategy doesn't fit scenario well):**

- Yellow caution symbol appears
- Bridget: "Hmm, let's think. For this problem, \[correct strategy\] would work better because \[brief reason\]. Let's try the next one!"
- Animation: Bridge segment appears but wobbles and doesn't lock into place; it fades away
- No segment added
- Sound: Gentle "wobble" sound (not negative buzzer)
- Progress stays same

**Step 5: Brief Reinforcement**

- Camera shows both islands
- If segment was added: bridge visibly extends closer to Problem Island
- Bridget adds one teaching sentence emphasizing the science:
  - "When friends listen, they understand the problem better."
  - "Compromise means both people get something they want."
  - "Taking turns is fair because everyone gets a chance."
  - "Asking for help is smart when you're stuck."

**Step 6: Problem Resolved Visual**

- If segment was added: The two children on Problem Island high-five or smile
- Brief animation (1-2 seconds) showing friendship maintained

**Step 7: Transition**

- Button appears: "Next Problem" (Button 5)
- Students click to proceed to next round
- Repeat Steps 1-7 for all 10 rounds

### Scoring

**Points System:**

- Each correct answer = 1 Bridge Segment added
- Maximum possible score: 10 segments (complete bridge)
- Progress displayed continuously: "Bridge Segments: \[X\] / 10"

**Visual Progression:**

- Bridge extends progressively from Friendship Island toward Problem Island
- Each segment is approximately 10% of the total gap
- Segments are numbered (1, 2, 3... up to 10) so students can see accumulation
- Bridge design: Wooden planks with rope sides and support posts (simple, age-appropriate engineering)

**No Individual Scoring:**

- This is a class cooperative game
- All students contribute to building one shared bridge
- Emphasis on collective problem-solving, not competition

- Animation: Foundation glows, tools appear ready for more building
- Badge appears: "Bridge Starter" with tool icon

**All outcomes are encouraging and growth-oriented**

**Final Screen Addition:**

- Bridget: "Remember: Disagreements are normal. What matters is using strategies to solve them together. That's what makes relationships stronger!"

**Final Button:**

- "Return to Lesson" (Button 5) - links back to lesson-07.03.html

### Continuity Note

**Builds on:** Lessons 1-2 taught that families and friendships are teams with specific roles and skills. Lesson 3 adds the realistic element that these teams sometimes face conflicts-and that conflicts aren't failures but opportunities to practice problem-solving strategies that strengthen the system.

**Prepares for:** Lesson 4 will celebrate diversity in relationships, showing that all families and friendships-regardless of their external form-use these same problem-solving strategies to maintain healthy connections. The bridge-building skill applies across all relationship types.

## In-Class-Game 7D – The Relationship Garden

**Lesson 4: Families and Friendships Come in Many Forms**

### Lesson Link & Learning Objective

Students will recognize and celebrate the diversity of family structures and friendship patterns, understanding that what makes relationships strong-whether families or friendships-is the quality of care, respect, and support within them, not their external form.

### Game File Name: ****icg-07.04-game01.html****

### Game Title: ****The Relationship Garden****

### **Game Format: Class Garden (Co-operative & Progressive)**

****Format Selection Rationale**:** This format has **0 uses** in Round 1, making it a priority selection for increasing format variety. The Class Garden mechanic is pedagogically ideal for Lesson 4 because it creates a powerful visual metaphor: diverse families and friendships are like different types of plants-they look different on the outside (different shapes, sizes, colors) but all grow strong through the same essential elements (care, respect, support, like water and sunlight). Each correct identification of caring behaviors "plants" a new flower or plant in the garden, visually demonstrating that what matters is the quality of care, not the external form. The progressive garden growth mechanic reinforces the lesson's core principle that diversity strengthens communities-a garden with many different plants is more beautiful and resilient than a garden with only one type. The collaborative classroom element (whole class grows one shared garden) mirrors the inclusive community the lesson aims to build, while the cause-effect relationship (recognizing care = garden grows) demonstrates that students can observe and identify relationship strength scientifically, regardless of how different relationships appear externally.

### **Purpose**: Students practice identifying care, respect, and support behaviors in diverse family and friendship scenarios. Each correct recognition that a relationship is strong (based on internal qualities, not external form) plants a flower or plant in the class garden, visually reinforcing that all relationship types are valuable when they demonstrate caring behaviors

### **Position in Lesson Arc**: EXPLORE B (10-22 minutes into 45-minute lesson)  

****Pedagogical Justification**:** The game is positioned early, immediately after students have:

- Been introduced to the concept that relationships come in many forms (guided discussion with initial examples)

This early placement is intentional and serves multiple pedagogical purposes:

- **Immediate Application:** Rather than waiting until late in the lesson, students immediately apply the "look for care/respect/support, not external form" framework to diverse examples, reinforcing the core concept through repeated observation.
- **Building Observational Data:** The extensive garden-building process (12 scenarios across diverse relationship types) provides rich experiential material that subsequent activities build upon. The video, quiz, and classroom activity can reference and deepen concepts students have already explored hands-on.
- **Normalizing Diversity Through Immersion:** Extended early exposure to many diverse relationship forms (10-12 minutes of varied examples) normalizes diversity before asking students to reflect personally or answer evaluative questions. This reduces potential discomfort or bias by establishing diversity as the baseline expectation.
- **Scientific Observer Role:** The garden metaphor positions students as objective scientists from the start-observing different "specimens," identifying common patterns (care behaviors), classifying based on observable qualities. This framework shapes how students approach the entire lesson.
- **Synthesis of Prior Learning:** As the unit's final game, it requires students to integrate all prior unit learning (recognizing roles from Lesson 1, identifying friendship skills from Lesson 2, observing problem-solving from Lesson 3) while adding the diversity dimension-thus requiring the most cognitive integration and deserving substantial time to work through varied examples.

The subsequent video, quiz, and activities serve to consolidate and personalize what students discovered in the garden rather than introduce new concepts.

### Setup

**Opening Screen:**

- Background: Empty garden plot with rich brown soil, white picket fence, blue sky, sun shining
- Center: Garden plot divided into 12 empty spaces (3 rows × 4 columns grid layout)
- Top right: Progress display showing "Plants Growing: 0 / 12"
- Avatar: "Flora the Gardener Fox" - friendly cartoon fox wearing gardening apron, sun hat, holding watering can
- Flora speaks in speech bubble: "Welcome to our Relationship Garden! Every family and friendship is like a plant-they all look different, but they all need the same things to grow strong: care, respect, and support. Let's see if we can fill our whole garden!"

**First Interaction:**

- Button appears center-screen: "Start Planting" (Button 5 to start)
- Students click Button 5
- Transition to Round 1

### Play

**Game Structure:** 12 rounds, each presenting a diverse family or friendship scenario

**Round Sequence (repeated 12 times):**

**Step 1: Scenario Presentation**

- Screen splits: left side shows animated scene, right side shows garden
- Animated mini-scene appears (5-7 seconds, looping) showing a family or friendship
- Flora narrates the scenario aloud, describing what's happening
- Example scenarios:

**Round 1:** Two moms helping their child with homework at kitchen table. All smiling, working together.  
Flora: "This family has two moms. They help their child learn and spend time together. Is this a strong, caring family?"

**Round 2:** Child lives with grandmother. Grandmother reads bedtime story, child cuddles close.  
Flora: "This child lives with their grandmother. She reads stories and cares for them every day. Is this a strong, caring family?"

**Round 3:** Two children of different races playing soccer together, high-fiving after goal.  
Flora: "These friends have different skin colors. They play together, celebrate each other's successes, and have fun. Is this a strong, caring friendship?"

**Round 4:** Large family dinner-parents, three kids, aunt, uncle, cousins all at table, passing food, talking, laughing.  
Flora: "This big family includes aunts, uncles, and cousins living together. They share meals and help each other. Is this a strong, caring family?"

**Round 5:** Single dad packing lunch for child, both smiling and talking in kitchen.  
Flora: "This child lives with their dad. He makes lunch, listens to them, and takes care of them. Is this a strong, caring family?"

**Round 6:** Two children sitting apart at lunch-one child gets up, walks over, invites the other to sit together.  
Flora: "One friend was alone. Another friend invited them to sit together and share lunch. Is this a strong, caring friendship?"

**Round 7:** Blended family-step-siblings playing board game together, step-parent helping younger child with game piece.  
Flora: "This family has step-siblings and a step-parent. They play together and help each other. Is this a strong, caring family?"

**Round 8:** Two children who look very different (one uses wheelchair, one doesn't)-both working on art project together, sharing materials.  
Flora: "These friends have different abilities. They share art supplies and create things together. Is this a strong, caring friendship?"

**Round 9:** Family with adopted child-different ethnicities-all hugging together in living room.  
Flora: "This family includes an adopted child. They hug, spend time together, and love each other. Is this a strong, caring family?"

**Round 10:** Child video-calling friend who moved away-both waving and smiling at screens.  
Flora: "These friends live far apart now. They stay in touch and care about each other. Is this a strong, caring friendship?"

**Round 11:** Two dads at playground pushing child on swing, all three laughing together.  
Flora: "This family has two dads. They play together and make their child happy. Is this a strong, caring family?"

**Round 12:** Three children of different cultural backgrounds (visible through clothing styles)-all working together on class project, respectfully listening to each other's ideas.  
Flora: "These friends come from different cultures. They respect each other's ideas and work as a team. Is this a strong, caring friendship?"

**Step 2: Question Appears**

- Large text appears on screen: "Is this a strong, caring \[family/friendship\]?"
- Two buttons appear, numbered 1-2:
  - Button 1: YES - This shows care, respect, and support
  - Button 2: NO - This doesn't show care, respect, or support
- All students select their answer using clicker (Buttons 1-2)

**Step 3: Class Response Processing**

- App records all responses
- Majority answer is selected as class answer
- (If tie, app randomly selects from tied options)

**Step 4: Feedback**

**If Correct (Answer: YES for all 12 scenarios-all show care):**

- Green checkmark appears
- Flora: "Yes! You spotted the care! Even though this \[family/friendship\] looks different from others, you can see \[specific caring behavior\]. That's what makes it strong!"
  - Examples of specific reinforcement:
    - "They help each other learn."
    - "They spend time together and show love."
    - "They celebrate each other and have fun together."
    - "They share and work as a team."
    - "They listen and respect differences."
    - "They include everyone."
    - "They stay connected even when apart."
- Animation: A plant or flower sprouts in one of the 12 empty garden spaces
  - Each plant is different (variety of flowers, heights, colors):
    - Rose, sunflower, tulip, daisy, lavender, lily, iris, carnation, daffodil, pansy, marigold, zinnia
  - Plants have different appearances (tall/short, different colors, different petal shapes)
  - Each plant has a small sign that appears with label: "Care," "Respect," "Support," "Kindness," "Love," "Teamwork," etc.
- Sound: Cheerful sprouting sound, gentle "bloom" chime
- Progress updates: "Plants Growing: \[X\] / 12"
- Flora adds: "Every relationship that shows care, respect, and support is valuable-no matter what it looks like!"

**If Incorrect (Answer: NO-student missed the caring behaviors):**

- Yellow caution symbol appears (not X-stays encouraging)
- Flora: "Let's look again. Can you see how they \[specific caring behavior\]? That shows this is a strong \[family/friendship\]! The way it looks on the outside doesn't tell us-it's the care inside that matters."
- Animation: Seed appears in garden space but doesn't sprout; it stays as a small dot
- No plant added yet
- Sound: Gentle "hmm" sound (not negative buzzer)
- Progress stays same
- Flora adds teaching moment: "Remember: We can't tell if a family or friendship is strong by how it looks. We have to observe the care, respect, and support."

**Step 5: Brief Reinforcement**

- Camera shows garden with any newly sprouted plants
- Flora adds one teaching sentence emphasizing the science:
  - "Scientists observe behaviors, not appearances."
  - "Care looks the same in every kind of relationship."
  - "Diversity makes our garden-and our world-more beautiful."
  - "What matters is how people treat each other, not what they look like."

**Step 6: Transition**

- Button appears: "Next Garden Spot" (Button 5)
- Students click to proceed to next round
- Camera pans back to show growing garden before next scenario
- Repeat Steps 1-6 for all 12 rounds

- Badge appears: "Garden Starter - Beginning Observer" with seed packet icon

**All outcomes are encouraging and emphasize growth mindset**

**Final Screen Addition (for all outcomes):**

- Flora: "Remember: Every family is different. Every friendship is different. And that's not just okay-it's wonderful! What makes them all strong is the same: care, respect, and support. When you see those things, you're seeing a strong relationship-no matter what it looks like!"

**Final Button:**

- "Return to Lesson" (Button 5) - links back to lesson-07.04.html

### Continuity Note

**Builds on:** Lessons 1-3 taught the structures, skills, and strategies that make relationships strong (roles, friendship qualities, problem-solving). Lesson 4 concludes the unit by showing that these same elements exist across ALL types of families and friendships-diversity in form doesn't change the fundamental science of what makes relationships work.

**Unit Completion:** This game completes the unit arc. Students leave understanding that relationships are observable systems (Lesson 1), built through specific skills (Lesson 2), maintained through problem-solving (Lesson 3), and valuable in all their diverse forms (Lesson 4). This builds self-efficacy ("I can understand and participate in healthy relationships") and resilience ("I can recognize and respect relationships that look different from mine").
