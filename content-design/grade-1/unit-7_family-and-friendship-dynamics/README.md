# Grade 1 · Unit 7 — Family and Friendship Dynamics

**Purpose**  
This unit extends students’ understanding of the mind from *individual processes* to *social systems*.  
Children learn that relationships — families, friendships, teams — are **systems of cooperation** where people take on roles, share responsibilities, and work toward shared well-being.  

By studying relationships as learnable systems rather than emotional mysteries, students discover that:

- Families are **our first teams**, where roles and responsibilities help the group function.  
- Friendship is a **skill**, built through kindness, listening, fairness, and respect.  
- Disagreements are **normal and solvable**, offering chances to practise cooperation and empathy.  
- Families and friendships **take many forms**, and diversity is a source of strength.  

Understanding relationships scientifically helps children see that connection, care, and inclusion are things they can *do*, not just feel — building confidence that they can make relationships healthy and resilient.

**Theory of Change**  
> **Knowledge** — Students learn that social groups (families, friendships, classrooms) are **systems with roles, rules, and cooperative functions**. They observe how behaviours like helping, sharing, and problem-solving sustain these systems (Bronfenbrenner; Tomasello; Bandura).  
> **→ Self-efficacy** — Through guided observation, discussion, and interactive practice, students realise that being a good family member or friend is a *learnable skill*. They gain confidence that they can contribute positively and handle conflict constructively (Bandura; Dweck).  
> **→ Mental resilience** — Recognising that differences and disagreements are natural parts of social life helps children remain calm, flexible, and inclusive. They learn that relationships grow stronger through empathy, compromise, and respect (Eisenberg; Masten).  

Together, these stages move students from passive participation to **active, confident relationship-building** — developing the mindset:  
> *“I can be a caring teammate, I can solve problems with others, and I can respect differences.”*

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this unit, students will be able to:

1. **Identify** the family as a team system in which members have different roles and responsibilities.  
2. **Describe** qualities of strong friendships — kindness, listening, sharing, taking turns, respect, trust.  
3. **Demonstrate** cooperative and caring behaviours that build friendships and family harmony.  
4. **Apply** simple conflict-resolution strategies such as listening, compromising, and asking for help.  
5. **Recognise and appreciate** diversity in family and friendship forms, showing empathy and inclusion toward others.

## Lesson Sequence
1. **L01 — Families Are Our First Teams**  
   Understanding that families function like teams, with members helping one another through different roles.

2. **L02 — What Makes a Good Friend**  
   Exploring the observable skills that make friendships strong and supportive.

3. **L03 — Solving Problems Together**  
   Learning that conflicts are normal and practising respectful problem-solving strategies.

4. **L04 — Families and Friendships Come in Many Forms**  
   Celebrating diversity in relationships and recognising that care and respect, not form, define strength.

## Digital & Interactive Components (MindMaster)
- **Psychology Experiments** – Interactive observation tasks such as *Family Roles Detective* and *Problem-Solving Steps* that let children study relationship dynamics as scientists.  
- **MindMaster Games** – Clicker-based, scenario-driven activities (*Family Team Puzzle*, *Friendship Skill Match*, *Problem-Solver Challenge*, *Spot Strong Relationships*) that transform social learning into play.  
- **Quizzes** – True/False and multiple-choice checks that reinforce teamwork, friendship qualities, and inclusion.  
- **Reflections** – Guided questions (*What’s Your Friendship Power?*, *How Do You Handle Disagreements?*) encouraging self-awareness and empathy.  
- **Teacher Dashboard** – Displays class trends in cooperative behaviour, empathy responses, and problem-solving success.

## Connection to Curriculum Arc
Unit 7 builds directly on **Unit 6: What Are Feelings?**, where students learned to recognise and interpret emotions.  
Now, they apply that emotional understanding to **relationships**, discovering how feelings, empathy, and communication operate in social systems.

This unit marks the expansion from **intrapersonal literacy** (understanding self) to **interpersonal literacy** (understanding relationships).  
Students develop:
- **Social cognition** — recognising patterns of cooperation and roles within groups.  
- **Empathy in action** — translating emotional understanding into supportive behaviour.  
- **Conflict competence** — viewing disagreement as a normal, solvable feature of human systems.  
- **Respect for diversity** — seeing difference as natural and enriching.  

Together, these skills cultivate the next layer of psychology literacy: **relationship intelligence** — the scientific, compassionate understanding of how human connections form, function, and thrive.  
Unit 7 closes Grade 1’s social-foundations arc, preparing students for later study of fairness, decision-making, and group problem-solving.
