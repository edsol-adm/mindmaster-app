# Lesson 2: What Makes a Good Friend

## Lesson Objective
Students will identify the key qualities that make friendships strong (kindness, listening, trust, sharing, taking turns, respect) and will understand that being a good friend is a learnable skill that improves with practice.

---

## Warm-Up (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *“Friendship Moment” – Spot the Good Friend*  

Show a quick image or act out two contrasting scenes:

**Scenario A:** Two children play with blocks, sharing and taking turns.  
**Scenario B:** One child keeps all the blocks and won’t let the other join.

Ask:  
> “In which scene are the children being good friends? Why?”

Take 2–3 answers. Guide toward:  
> “In Scenario A, they share, they take turns, they’re kind. That’s what good friends do.”

**Transition:**  
> “Today, we’re learning about the specific things good friends do—and the cool thing is, anyone can learn to be a good friend.”

## Explore + Practice (30 minutes)

### Explore A: Psychology Experiment – “Good Friend or Not?” (7 minutes)

**MindMaster:** In-Class Experiment (with clicker technology)  

This experiment presents friendship situations so students can identify friendship-building behaviours.

**Game Flow:**

- **Setup:**  
  MindMaster displays short scenarios (text or images) showing two children interacting.  
  Each student has a clicker.  
  Teacher explains:  
  > “You’ll see what two friends are doing. Your job: Is this a good friend? YES or NO?”

- **Scenarios (8–10):**  
  - Maya lends her pencil to a friend. → YES  
  - Kai won’t let anyone play in his game. → NO  
  - Sam listens when her friend is upset. → YES  
  - Alex says mean words to make others laugh. → NO  
  - Jordan takes turns on the swings. → YES  
  - Casey excludes someone from the group. → NO  
  - Ava keeps a friend’s secret. → YES  
  - Mira blames a friend when something goes wrong. → NO  

- **Play:**  
  Each scenario appears with text + image.  
  Students tap button 1 = YES / Good Friend, button 2 = NO / Not a Good Friend.  
  On-screen feedback and teacher affirmation after each.

- **Scoring:** +1 point per correct.  
- **Win Condition:** 7 + correct = “Friend Champion!”  
  If class average ≥ 7 = class celebration.

*Teacher Note:* This experiment reveals students’ understanding of friendship qualities and provides immediate feedback on which behaviours build relationships.

### Explore B: Video – Watching Friendship in Action (3 minutes)

**Media:** YouTube Video  
**Title:** *“Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood: When Friends Play Together”*  
**Link:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOOgxPN8vFw  
**Duration:** ~2 minutes  

> **Note:** This video is *indicative only*. In the full MindMaster version, a copyright-free or modified video will be featured to illustrate the same concept of friendship skills.

**Teacher Setup:**  
“Watch how Daniel and his friends are good friends to each other.  
Notice: Do they listen? Do they share? Do they take turns?”

After viewing, discuss:
1. “What did you see Daniel’s friends do that was kind?”  
2. “How did listening help them play better together?”

---

### Practice A: Guided Discussion + Concept Introduction (5 minutes)

**Classroom Resource:** Teacher-Led Discussion + Visual Aid  

Introduce core friendship qualities in clear language:

> “Good friends have things they do that make the friendship strong. Let’s name them:  
> – Kindness – say nice things, don’t hurt feelings.  
> – Listening – care what your friend says.  
> – Sharing – let friends use your things and play with them.  
> – Taking Turns – let others have a turn.  
> – Keeping Promises – do what you say you’ll do.  
> – Respect – treat your friend the way you want to be treated.”

Display these on a chart. Ask:  
> “Can anyone give an example of one of these? What does *being kind to a friend* look like?”

Take 2–3 examples and affirm.

**Key point:**  
> “You’re not born knowing how to be a good friend. These are skills you learn and practice. Every time you listen or take turns, you’re getting better at friendship.”

---

### Practice B: Role-Play Activity – “Friendship Skills in Action” (8 minutes)

**Classroom Resource:** Scenario Cards + Role-Play  

Students practise friendship skills through short role-plays.

**Setup:** Prepare 3–4 cards such as:
- “Your friend wants to play a game you don’t like.”  
- “Your friend is sad because no one is playing with them.”  
- “You both want the same toy.”  
- “Your friend didn’t keep a promise.”  

**Activity:**  
1. Read scenario aloud.  
2. Ask: “What would a good friend do here?”  
3. Invite 2–3 volunteers to act it out (30 seconds each).  
4. After each role-play, ask: “What friendship skill did they use?”  

*Teacher Prompt:* “Friends use these skills to keep their friendships strong. Let’s see how.”

### Practice C: MindMaster Game – “Friendship Skill Match” (7 minutes)

**MindMaster:** In-Class Game (with clicker technology)  
**Game Format:** Matching / Pairing (connect scenarios to skills)

**Game Flow:**
- **Setup:**  
  Screen left = 6 friendship scenarios; right = 6 skills (Kindness, Listening, Sharing, Taking Turns, Keeping Promises, Respect).  
  Students have clickers (Buttons 1–6).  
  Teacher: > “You’ll see a friend doing something. Which skill are they using? Tap the number.”

- **Play (6–8 scenarios):**  
  - Sam listens when his friend tells him about his day. → Listening  
  - Kai lets another child go first in line. → Taking Turns  
  - Ava says something kind to cheer a sad friend. → Kindness  
  - Mira plays the game her friend wants. → Respect  
  - Jordan promised to sit with a friend and did. → Keeping Promises  
  - Casey shares a snack. → Sharing  

- **Scoring:** +1 point per correct.  
- **Win Condition:** 6/6 correct = “Friendship Master!”  Class average ≥ 5 = “Good Friends” badge.  
- **Timing:** 6–8 minutes.

*Teacher Note:* Reinforces that friendship skills are observable, learnable behaviours—not fixed traits.

## Reflection (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *MindMaster Reflection – “What’s Your Friendship Power?”*  

**Game Flow:**
- **Setup:**  
  On-screen questions appear one at a time; students respond via clickers.  
- **Prompts (4–5):**
  1. “Which friendship skill do YOU use the most?”  
     (1 = Kindness  2 = Listening  3 = Sharing  4 = Taking Turns  5 = Something else)  
  2. “Which skill do you want to practise more?” (same options)  
  3. “Do you think you were born knowing how to be a good friend, or did you learn it?” (1 = Born  2 = Learned)  

Teacher shows live tallies and celebrates:  
> “Wow—many of us are good listeners! Practising makes us better scientists of friendship.”

*No individual scoring; collective reflection builds community.*

## Home Prep (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *Send-Home Clicker Quiz Preparation*  

**Teacher Explanation:**  
> “Tonight, you’ll do a short quiz on MindMaster at home about friendship skills. You’ll see situations and answer YES or NO: Is that a good friend?”

**In-Class Practice:**  
> “If your friend lets you play with their toy, is that a good friend? YES or NO?”

Celebrate correct responses.

**Homework Letter:**

> Tonight they’ll do a 5-minute MindMaster quiz with YES/NO questions about friendship.  
> Celebrate their answers—they’re learning the *science of friendship!*  

*Teacher Note:* Emphasize that students are “friendship scientists”—they’re studying how friendship works by observing and practising.
