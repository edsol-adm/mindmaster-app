# Grade 1 · Unit 2 — Exploring Our Senses (Sight, Sound, Touch)

**Purpose**  
This unit introduces students to **sensation as the mind’s information-gathering system**.  
Students learn that the senses act like “doorways,” bringing different kinds of data from the outside world into the mind. Through guided exploration, structured activities, and classroom experiments, they discover how:

- **Sight, sound, and touch** provide different kinds of information.  
- Each sense has a **specialised, irreplaceable role** in perception.  
- Senses work **together as a team** to give the mind a clearer picture of reality.  
- **Individuals experience sensory input differently**, and this diversity is normal.

By building these foundations, students begin to see psychology as a **science of how the mind connects with the world**, fostering curiosity, empathy, and early self-awareness.

**Theory of Change**  
> **Knowledge** — Students learn how the senses function as the mind’s organised information systems, and that sensory experiences vary across individuals.  
> **→ Self-efficacy** — Students gain confidence in observing and understanding their own sensory experiences and learning preferences.  
> **→ Mental resilience** — Students develop empathy, respect for differences, and the ability to adapt their behaviour and environment to support themselves and others.

This progression supports early psychological literacy — helping children understand not only *how their minds work*, but also *how to navigate differences* constructively in shared spaces.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this unit, students will be able to:

1. **Identify** the three main senses (sight, sound, touch) and match each to the type of information it gathers.  
2. **Describe** how each sense helps the mind notice and learn about the world using everyday examples.  
3. **Demonstrate** how senses work together to create clearer understanding.  
4. **Recognise** differences in personal sensory preferences or sensitivities.  
5. **Apply** empathy and respect for sensory differences by suggesting or using simple accommodations that support everyone.

1. **L01 — Our Senses: The Mind’s Doorways**  
   Introduction to senses as information systems that connect the outside world to the mind.  

2. **L02 — Each Sense Tells Us Something Different**  
   Understanding the unique and specialised role of each sense.  

3. **L03 — How Senses Work Together**  
   Exploring how sight, sound, and touch work as a team to give fuller understanding.  

4. **L04 — People Experience Senses in Different Ways**  
   Recognising sensory differences and learning to respond with empathy and respect.

## Digital & Interactive Components (MindMaster)
- **MindMaster Experiments & Games** – Matching, sorting, and scenario-based activities reinforcing how senses work individually and together.  
- **Quizzes** – Image-based multiple choice to consolidate knowledge.  
- **At-Home Reflections** – Simple, accessible activities that involve parents and extend sensory exploration beyond the classroom.  
- **Teacher Dashboard** – Shows class participation and lesson-specific averages for pilot monitoring.

## Connection to Curriculum Arc
Unit 2 builds directly on the **three-part mind framework** introduced in Unit 1.  
Where Unit 1 established *how* the mind works internally, this unit explains *how information enters the mind through sensory systems*.  
This supports children in developing:
- **Self-awareness** — noticing their own sensory patterns,  
- **Empathy** — understanding that others experience the world differently, and  
- **Resilience** — adapting and responding thoughtfully to diverse environments.

This sensory foundation prepares students for later units that explore attention, memory, imagination, and emotional regulation.
