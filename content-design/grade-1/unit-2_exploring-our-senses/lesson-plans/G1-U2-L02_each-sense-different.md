## Lesson Objective
Students will understand that each sense provides a **unique type of information** that cannot be replaced by another sense, and will identify which sense(s) are most useful for specific situations.

---

## Warm-Up (5 min) – “The Sense Reporter Game”

**Activity Steps**
1. Introduce: “Each sense is like a **reporter**. Reporters can only tell us about their special job—they can’t do each other’s job.”
2. Demonstrate three reporters:
   - **Eyes Reporter:** “I can tell you it’s red and square, but I can’t tell you how it sounds.”
   - **Ears Reporter:** “I can tell you it’s loud and goes beep-beep, but I can’t tell you what colour it is.”
   - **Touch Reporter:** “I can tell you it’s smooth and cold, but I can’t tell you what it looks like.”
3. Ask: “Why can’t one reporter do another’s job?” → Guide students to see that each sense collects different data.

**Materials:** three large “Reporter Cards” (eyes, ears, touch).

## Explore + Practice (30 min total)

### Part A – What Each Sense Knows (7 min)
- Display Reporter Cards and discuss what each sense **can** and **cannot** tell us.
- Build a simple chart with students:

| Sense | Can Tell Us                    | Cannot Tell Us                     |
|-------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Sight | colours, shapes, size, movement | sounds, textures, tastes            |
| Sound | voices, music, noises, warnings | colours, shapes, textures           |
| Touch | textures, temperature, pressure | colours, sounds, what something looks like |

- Emphasise: “A sense is good at ONE job. You can’t see a song. You can’t hear a colour. You can’t feel what something looks like with just your hands.”
- Psychology connection: “Each sense has its own special job that helps the mind learn.”

**Materials:** Reporter Cards, chart paper or whiteboard.

### Psychology Video (Sample Placeholder) (2 min)
**Title:** *The Five Senses for Kids*  
**Link:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUMiPK6LZBI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUMiPK6LZBI)  
**Purpose:** Simple visual explanation of how each sense gathers different types of information.  
**Usage Note:** This is a **sample reference only**. A final version will use original or properly licensed content.  
**Discussion:** “The video shows how each sense has its own job. No other sense can do that job exactly the same.”

### Part B – Psychology Test/Experiment (8 min) · “The Sense Reporter Challenge”
**Format:** MindMaster app

**Steps**
1. Teacher displays sensory scenarios on screen.  
2. Students choose which sense they would use to gather that information.  
3. Example scenarios:
   - Feeling if a blanket is soft → touch  
   - Knowing if a shirt is red → sight  
   - Hearing a friend call → sound  
   - Checking if water is hot or cold → touch  
   - Hearing music → sound  
   - Seeing a butterfly land → sight  
   - Feeling raindrops → touch  
   - Hearing teacher’s voice → sound

**Scoring:** 1 point per correct answer.  
**Feedback:** Immediate.  
**Win condition:** 6+ correct = “Sense Expert”.

**Materials:** MindMaster app, clickers.

### Part C – Real-Life Sense Specialists (8 min)
- Present short scenarios and ask students: “Which sense(s) do we NEED here?”
  - Finding your parent in a crowded market → hearing + sight
  - Knowing if it’s raining → sight + touch
  - Understanding a friend’s emotion → sight (face), sound (tone)
  - Choosing ripe fruit → sight + touch
  - Playing catch → sight + touch
  - Reading aloud → sight + sound
- Discuss how some activities rely on one sense more than others, and some need more than one.

**Psychology Insight:** “This is why people with different sensory abilities use different tools. A person who can’t see might use their ears and hands to explore the world — and their senses do amazing things.”

**Materials:** scenario cards or slides.

### MindMaster Game (6 min) · “Sense Specialist Sorting”
**Format:** Sorting/Categorising (Drag into Baskets)  
Students sort activities or objects into sense baskets: sight / sound / touch.

- **Setup:** Three baskets on screen labelled SIGHT, SOUND, TOUCH.  
- 12 cards with objects or activities appear.  
- Students drag each card to the correct basket.

**Sample Cards:** reading a book, hearing music, holding an apple, touching sand, watching a movie, listening to a friend, feeling ice, seeing colours, hearing a bell, touching silk, looking at the moon, hearing laughter.

**Scoring:** 1 point per correct sort. Timer: 3 min.

**Materials:** MindMaster app, clickers.

### MindMaster Quiz (5 min) · “What Does Each Sense Know?”
**Format:** Multiple choice, visual identification.

**Sample Questions**
1. Which sense tells you if something is loud? (A: sight / B: sound / C: touch)  
2. Can your ears tell you what colour something is? (A: yes / B: no / C: maybe)  
3. If you close your eyes and touch a ball, what can your skin tell you? (A: colour / B: how smooth it is / C: sound)

5. Your friend’s voice sounds happy. Which sense are you using? (A: sight / B: sound / C: touch)  
6. You want to know if soup is hot. Which sense helps you? (A: eyes / B: ears / C: skin/touch)

**Feedback:** Immediate with explanation.

**Materials:** MindMaster app, clickers.

## Reflection (5 min) – “If I Could Only Use One Sense…”
**Activity**
1. Display prompt on screen: “Which sense would be the HARDEST for you to live without? Why?”  
2. Students vote using clickers:
   - A: Sight
   - B: Sound
   - C: Touch
   - D: I’m not sure
3. Teacher facilitates short class discussion: “Look, we all chose different answers. That’s because each sense is special.”

**Materials:** MindMaster app, clickers.

## Home Prep (5 min) – Preparing for MindMaster at Home
Explain:
> “Tonight, you’ll play **Sense Reporter** at home. You’ll see pictures and questions about what each sense can do. Can you become a Sense Expert?”

**Parent Instructions**
- Open MindMaster app → select “Lesson 2: Sense Reporter”
- Child answers 8 short questions (~5 min)
- Discuss which sense they thought was “the coolest.”

**Materials:** MindMaster app.

## Connection to Unit Arc
- **Lesson 1:** Introduced senses as **doorways**.  
- **Lesson 2:** Shows that each sense has a **specialised, irreplaceable job**.  
- **Lesson 3:** Will highlight how senses work **together**.  
- **Lesson 4:** Explores how people experience senses **differently**.  
This builds a clear understanding of how the mind gathers different types of information.
