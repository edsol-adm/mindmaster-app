## Lesson Objective
Students will identify the three main senses (**sight**, **sound**, **touch**) as **doorways** that bring information into the mind, and recognise that without senses, the mind would not know what is happening in the world.

---

## Warm-Up (5 min) – “Secret Sense Detective”

**Activity Steps**
1. Tell students: “I'm going to do something, and you have to guess what I'm doing—but you can only use ONE sense.”
   - Cover eyes → make a sound (e.g., clap, ring a bell). Ask: “What did your ears tell you?”
   - Cover ears → let them watch your face. Ask: “What did your eyes tell you?”
   - Close eyes and ears → let them touch an object. Ask: “What did your skin tell you?”
2. Frame: “Our senses are like doorways to the world. Each one lets in different information. Today, we’ll learn how these doorways work.”

**Materials:** soft toy or textured object, small bell or sound-making object.

## Explore + Practice (30 min total)

### Part A – Introducing the Three Doorways (8 min)
- Display three illustrated “doorways” labelled **SIGHT**, **SOUND**, and **TOUCH**.
- Brainstorm with students what information comes through each.

| Doorway | Examples of Information |
|---------|--------------------------|
| Sight   | Colours, shapes, faces, toys, food, danger signals |
| Sound   | Voices, music, sirens, laughter |
| Touch   | Soft/hard, warm/cold, smooth/rough, pain signals |

- Ask: “Why does the mind need all three? What would happen if we only had one doorway?”
- Frame: “The mind is like the centre of a building. The senses are the doorways letting information in. Without doorways, the building wouldn’t know anything about the outside world.”

**Materials:** poster/whiteboard with illustrated doorways.

### Psychology Video (3 min)
**Title:** *The Five Senses Song | Noodle & Pals*  
**Link:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVymeq5NSTI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVymeq5NSTI)  
**Purpose:** Introduces the five senses in a fun, age-appropriate way while focusing on three for the lesson.  
**Discussion:** “This song shows all five doorways that help our minds collect information from the world. Today we’ll explore sight, sound, and touch.”

### Part B – Psychology Experiment (8 min) · “The Doorway Detective Test”
This in-class experiment shows how senses give different kinds of information and work together.

**Steps**
1. **Eyes only** — Show object for 3 sec. Ask: “What did your eyes tell you?”  
2. **Ears only** — Ring or shake object. Ask: “What did your ears tell you?”  
3. **Touch only** — Let students hold object (eyes closed). Ask: “What did your skin tell you?”  
4. **Combine senses** — Show, let them touch, play sound.  
5. **Reflection** — “Which doorway gave the most information? Which gave different information?”

**Key Insight:** Each doorway brings different types of information. The mind uses all of them together.

**Materials:** 5–6 small objects with distinct sensory qualities (cotton ball, apple, bell, toy car, rough rock).

---

### Part C – Guided Observation (8 min) · “Doorways in My Day”
- Give each student an observation sheet divided into three columns: *EYES SEE* / *EARS HEAR* / *SKIN FEELS*.
- Ask students to think about a daily activity (eating lunch, playing outside, getting dressed) and note what each sense contributed.
- Share a few examples.

**Materials:** observation sheet (hard copy).

---

### MindMaster Game (6 min) · “Doorway Match”
**Format:** Matching Pairs (Memory Flip)  
Students match activities to the sense(s) that support them.

- **Setup:** 12 cards (6 pairs) — activities and sense icons.
- Students flip cards to match activity and sense.
- Timer: 2 min. 1 point per correct match.

**Sample Pairs:**  
- Eating → taste/touch  
- Listening to music → hearing  
- Hugging friend → touch  
- Looking at a book → sight  
- Playing catch → sight + touch  
- Touching a soft blanket → touch

**Materials:** MindMaster app, student clickers.

---

### MindMaster Quiz (5 min) · “Doorway Knowledge Check”
**Format:** Multiple choice, image-based identification.

**Sample Questions**
1. Which doorway tells us if something is cold or hot? (eyes / ears / skin)  
2. Which sense helps us find our shoes? (hearing / sight / touch)  
3. What does the SOUND doorway let into our mind? (colours / voices and noises / textures)  
4. If we could only use our EYES, what would we NOT be able to do? (see colours / hear a friend call / find things)  
5. Which doorway helps us know if something is soft or hard? (sight / touch / sound)

**Feedback:** Immediate; correct answers explained aloud.

**Materials:** MindMaster app, clickers.

## Reflection (5 min) – “The Doorways I Used Today”
**Discussion Prompts**
- “What was the most interesting thing you learned about your senses today?”
- “Which doorway do you use the most? Why?”
- “Can you think of a time today when you used all three senses at the same time?”

Teacher reinforces:
> “The senses are not random — they are organised information systems that help the mind understand the world.”

**Materials:** none.

---

## Home Prep (5 min) – Preparing for MindMaster at Home
Explain:
> “Tonight, you’ll play **Sense Hunt** at home. You’ll see pictures of things on the screen and choose which sense helps you experience them.”

**Parent Instructions**
- Open MindMaster app → select “Lesson 1: Sense Hunt”
- Child answers 8 short questions (~5 min)
- If app can’t load, child lists three things they saw, heard, and touched.

**Materials:** MindMaster app.

## Connection to Unit Arc
This foundational lesson introduces **senses as doorways** — the mind’s information-gathering systems.  
- **Lesson 2:** Each sense has a unique role.  
- **Lesson 3:** Senses work together.  
- **Lesson 4:** People experience senses differently.  
This builds **self-efficacy** (“I understand how my mind works”) and **mental resilience** (“I can use my senses to learn and respond”).
