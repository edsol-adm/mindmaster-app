## In-Class-Game 2A – Doorway Lock and Key

# LESSON 1: Our Senses - The Mind's Doorways

**Lesson Link & Learning Objective**

Students will identify the three main senses (sight, sound, touch) as doorways that bring information into the mind, and recognize that without senses, the mind would not know what is happening in the world.

**Game File Name: icg-02.01-game01.html**

**Game Title: Doorway Lock and Key**

**Game Format: Virtual Experiment (Sensory Deprivation Simulation with Progressive Discovery)**

This format allows students to actively manipulate which sensory "doorways" are open or closed, directly experiencing how each sense contributes unique information to the mind. It goes beyond multiple choice by creating an interactive laboratory where students test hypotheses about sensory input.

**Purpose:** Students experimentally discover that each sense acts as a unique information doorway by selectively "opening" and "closing" sensory channels to observe what the mind can and cannot know in different scenarios. This reinforces the scientific principle that senses are organized systems providing specific data types.

**Lesson Placement & Pedagogical Justification**

**Location:** Explore B section (replaces existing "Doorway Detective" game) **Timing:** Approximately 23-30 minutes into the 45-minute lesson (after Explore A and video, before in-class quiz)

**Pedagogical Justification:** At this point, students have been introduced to the three senses as doorways (Explore A) and seen the video reinforcing this concept. They are now ready for hands-on experimentation where they actively control sensory input and observe outcomes. This placement allows them to test their understanding through discovery before the summative quiz, creating deeper learning through experience rather than passive observation.

**Setup**

**Opening Screen:** Students see a friendly cartoon character named **"Kimi the Sense Detective"** (gender-neutral child with detective hat and magnifying glass) standing in front of a cozy room with three large, colorful doorways:

- **Blue Doorway (left):** Labeled "SIGHT" with eye symbols
- **Yellow Doorway (center):** Labeled "SOUND" with ear symbols
- **Green Doorway (right):** Labeled "TOUCH" with hand symbols

**Text on screen:** "Welcome, Sense Detective! The Mind needs information from the world. Your job: Open the right doorways to help the Mind understand what's happening!"

**Visual indicator:** Each doorway has a large padlock icon (currently locked/gray). Above the doorways is a thought bubble labeled "THE MIND" showing a question mark.

**Clicker Instructions Display:**

- Buttons 1-3: Open/Close individual doorways (1=Sight, 2=Sound, 3=Touch)
- Button 4: Test the scenario (see what the Mind knows)
- Button 5: Next scenario

**Introductory Demo (Teacher-guided, 30 seconds):** Teacher says: "Press Button 1 to open the SIGHT doorway." \[Students press 1 → Blue doorway unlocks, glows, opens\] "Now press Button 4 to test what the Mind can know." \[Mind bubble shows: "I can see colors and shapes!"\] "Good! Now press Button 1 again to close it." \[Blue doorway closes and locks\] "Press Button 2 to open SOUND." \[Yellow doorway opens\] "Press 4 to test." \[Mind bubble shows: "I can hear voices and noises!"\]

"Great! You're ready to be Sense Detectives. Let's play!"

**Play**

## In-Class-Game 2B – Sense Reporter Dispatch

# LESSON 2: Each Sense Tells Us Something Different

**Lesson Link & Learning Objective**

Students will understand that each sense provides a unique type of information that cannot be replaced by another sense, and will identify which sense(s) are most useful for specific situations.

**Game File Name:** icg-02.02-game01.html

**Game Title: Sense Reporter Dispatch**

**Game Format: Match Character to Scenario (with Drag-and-Sort Mechanics + Timed Decision-Making)**

This format transforms the concept of "sense reporters" into an engaging dispatch game where students must quickly analyze what type of information is needed and assign the correct sensory "specialist" to gather it. It goes beyond simple matching by requiring reasoning about sensory capabilities and limitations, with progressive difficulty and time pressure creating engagement.

**Purpose:** Students learn through rapid analysis and decision-making that each sense has a specialized job that cannot be performed by other senses. By acting as "Dispatch Coordinator," students must diagnose information needs and match them to the correct sensory reporter, reinforcing the irreplaceability of each sense.

**Lesson Placement:** Explore B section

**Timing:** Approximately 25-33 minutes into the 45-minute lesson (after Explore A, video, and psychology test, before in-class quiz)

**Pedagogical Justification:** Students have just learned about each sense's unique capabilities through Explore A's "Reporter Cards" chart and observed the video demonstrating sensory specialization. They've completed the clicker-based psychology test identifying which sense gathers which information. Now they're ready for a more complex application where they must rapidly analyze scenarios, consider multiple factors (what information is needed, which sense can provide it, which senses cannot), and make strategic decisions. This placement allows them to practice discriminating between sensory capabilities before the summative quiz, building fluency through repeated, varied scenarios.

**Setup**

**Opening Screen:** Students see **Kimi the Sense Detective** (same character from Lesson 1, maintaining continuity) now wearing a headset and sitting at a "Dispatch Center" desk with three glowing communication screens.

**Scene Description:** The dispatch center has three stations, each with a distinct color and reporter character:

**Left Station (BLUE) - Vision Reporter "V.J." (Visual Jamie):**

- Cartoon character with big observant eyes, wearing blue uniform with eye badge
- Speech bubble: "I spot colors, shapes, and movements!"
- Visual tag below: "EXPERT: What things LOOK like"

**Center Station (YELLOW) - Hearing Reporter "Echo" (sound specialist):**

- Cartoon character with large ears, wearing yellow uniform with ear badge
- Speech bubble: "I catch sounds, voices, and noises!"
- Visual tag below: "EXPERT: What things SOUND like"

**Right Station (GREEN) - Touch Reporter "Tex" (texture specialist):**

- Cartoon character with sensitive hands, wearing green uniform with hand badge
- Speech bubble: "I feel textures, temperatures, and pressure!"
- Visual tag below: "EXPERT: How things FEEL"

**Title Text:** "SENSE DISPATCH CENTER - Jobs Are Coming In! Send the RIGHT reporter for each job!"

**Subtitle:** "Remember: Each reporter has ONE special talent. Send the expert who can gather the information needed!"

**Clicker Instructions Display:**

- Button 1: Send V.J. (Vision Reporter)
- Button 2: Send Echo (Hearing Reporter)
- Button 3: Send Tex (Touch Reporter)
- Button 7: "Need Help?" (Shows reporter capabilities reminder)
- Button 8: "Speed Bonus Active" indicator (lights up when available)

**Tutorial Prompt (Teacher-guided, 45 seconds):** Kimi says: "Detectives, we have an urgent job! Someone needs to know: IS THE LIGHT ON OR OFF?"

Screen shows a lamp image with question mark.

"Which reporter should we send? Press their number!"

- Button 1 = V.J. (Vision)
- Button 2 = Echo (Hearing)
- Button 3 = Tex (Touch)

**Correct Answer: Button 1 (V.J.)**

**Feedback Animation:**

- V.J. zooms to the lamp
- Returns with report card showing: "REPORT: The light is ON. It's bright yellow!"
- Checkmark appears
- Kimi says: "Perfect! Only VISION can tell us what something LOOKS like!"

**Wrong Answer Example (if Button 2 pressed):**

- Echo zooms to lamp
- Returns confused with report card showing: "REPORT: I don't hear anything special... I can't help with this job!"
- X appears
- Kimi says: "Oops! Echo reports on SOUNDS, not sight. Try another reporter!"

"Now you're ready! Let's start the real dispatch work!"

**Play**

**Game Structure:** 12 rapid-fire dispatch scenarios across 3 rounds of increasing difficulty

**Core Mechanic:**

- Job request appears on screen with scenario description and image
- Students have 8-15 seconds (varies by difficulty) to analyze and select correct reporter
- Press Button 1, 2, or 3 to dispatch reporter

- **200-269 points:** "Expert Dispatcher" ⭐⭐ + Silver Badge
- **130-199 points:** "Skilled Dispatcher" ⭐ + Bronze Badge
- **Below 130:** "Dispatcher in Training" (encouragement message)

**No Competition Focus:** Teacher screen shows class aggregate: "Our class completed \[X\] total dispatches!" - celebrates collective learning, not individual ranking.

**Win Condition**

Students complete the game when they:

- Complete all 12 dispatch jobs (across 3 rounds)
- Reach the final victory screen with all three reporters together
- Receive their achievement tier and badge
- See Kimi's final teaching summary

**Completion Criteria:**

- Must attempt all 12 jobs (wrong answers don't prevent progression, but reduce points)
- Each job allows up to 2 dispatch attempts before auto-advancing
- Timer expiration counts as an attempt

**Teacher Controls:**

- Pause between rounds for discussion
- Skip to next round if time constrained
- Replay any specific job for whole-class review

**Continuity Note**

**Connection to Lesson 1:** Kimi the Sense Detective returns from Lesson 1's "Doorway Lock & Key" game, but now in a new role as Dispatch Coordinator. This maintains character familiarity while showing progression in understanding - students move from "opening doorways" (basic concept) to "matching specialized reporters to jobs" (deeper discrimination of sensory capabilities).

**Connection to Future Lessons:**

- **Lesson 3:** Students will discover that while each reporter has ONE special job (reinforced here), reporters often work TOGETHER on the same assignment to provide fuller information. This game establishes the baseline of individual specialization that makes teamwork valuable.
- **Lesson 4:** Students will learn that different people's "reporters" may have different sensitivity levels - some V.J.s see more clearly, some Echos hear more sensitively. This game establishes the standard capabilities that will later be shown to vary.

**Character Continuity:** The three reporter characters (V.J., Echo, Tex) are introduced here and will reappear as a team in Lesson 3's game, creating narrative continuity and making the transition to "multisensory integration" more concrete.

## In-Class-Game 2C – Sense Team Power-Up

# LESSON 3: How Senses Work Together

**Lesson Link & Learning Objective**

Students will understand that the mind typically combines information from multiple senses to create fuller, more reliable understanding, and will experience how multisensory integration makes tasks easier and clearer.

**Game File Name: icg-02.03-game01.html**

**Game Title: Sense Team Power-Up**

**Game Format: Cause & Effect Chains (Multisensory Integration Simulator with Progressive Unlocking)**

This format allows students to actively construct sensory combinations and immediately observe the effects on understanding and performance. Unlike simple selection games, students build chains by adding senses one at a time, creating visual cause-effect relationships. The progressive unlocking mechanic shows how each additional sense strengthens the mind's understanding, making the concept of multisensory integration concrete and experiential.

**Purpose:** Students discover through hands-on experimentation that combining multiple senses creates richer, faster, and more reliable understanding than using senses in isolation. By building sensory "teams" and observing performance improvements, students learn that multisensory integration is how the mind naturally operates to maximize information gathering.

**Lesson Placement:** Explore B section (replaces existing "Sense Team Builder" game) **Timing:** Approximately 24-33 minutes into the 45-minute lesson (after Explore A "Senses Are Teammates" discussion, video on sensory integration, and psychology test, before in-class quiz)

**Pedagogical Justification:** Students have just learned the concept of multisensory teamwork through Explore A's "Team Senses" diagram and watched the video demonstrating how the brain combines sensory inputs. They've completed the psychology test experiencing multisensory advantage firsthand. Now they need hands-on practice constructing sensory combinations and observing the direct effects. This placement allows them to actively experiment with integration principles before the summative quiz, building deep understanding through manipulation and observation of cause-effect relationships. The game transitions them from passive learning about teamwork to active construction of effective sensory teams.

**Setup**

**Opening Screen:** Students see a new character: **"Dr. Synergy"** (friendly scientist character with lab coat, goggles, different from Kimi-establishing this as Lessons 3-4's shared avatar). Dr. Synergy stands in a bright laboratory with a large "Mind Performance Monitor" display showing a brain silhouette.

**Scene Description:** The laboratory has three glowing "Sense Power Stations" arranged in an arc:

**Left Station (BLUE) - SIGHT Power:**

- Large eye icon with radiating blue light
- Status: "Ready to activate"
- Power indicator: Empty battery bars (0/3)

**Center Station (YELLOW) - SOUND Power:**

- Large ear icon with radiating yellow light
- Status: "Ready to activate"
- Power indicator: Empty battery bars (0/3)

**Right Station (GREEN) - TOUCH Power:**

- Large hand icon with radiating green light
- Status: "Ready to activate"
- Power indicator: Empty battery bars (0/3)

**Center Screen - Mind Performance Monitor:**

- Large display showing brain with connection pathways
- Performance meter: Currently at 0% ("Minimal Understanding")
- "Information Quality" gauge: Empty
- "Speed" gauge: Empty
- "Clarity" gauge: Empty

**Title Text:** "SENSE TEAM LABORATORY - Discover the Power of Working Together!"

**Subtitle:** "Dr. Synergy needs your help! Build sensory teams and watch how the Mind's understanding improves!"

**Clicker Instructions Display:**

- Button 1: Activate/Add SIGHT power (can press multiple times)
- Button 2: Activate/Add SOUND power (can press multiple times)
- Button 3: Activate/Add TOUCH power (can press multiple times)
- Button 4: TEST the combination (run experiment)
- Button 5: NEXT challenge (after completing current one)
- Button 6: RESET current combination (clear all powers)
- Button 9: "Lab Notes" (shows what each gauge measures)

**Tutorial Sequence (Teacher-guided, 90 seconds):**

Dr. Synergy says: "Welcome to my laboratory! Today we're studying how the Mind works better when senses team up. Let's start with a simple test!"

**Tutorial Challenge: "Identifying a Friend Across the Playground"**

Screen shows playground scene with child in distance (silhouette).

Dr. Synergy: "The Mind needs to know: WHO is that friend? Let's try using just ONE sense first."

**Step 1: Single Sense Test** "Press Button 1 to activate SIGHT power, then Button 4 to TEST!"

Student actions:

- Press Button 1 → SIGHT station glows blue, battery shows 1/3
- Press Button 4 → TEST runs

**Result Animation:**

- Brain pathways light up (blue only)
- Performance Monitor shows:
  - Performance: 40% ("Basic Understanding")
  - Information Quality: Low (yellow)
  - Speed: Slow
  - Clarity: Moderate
- Screen shows: "The Mind sees a person... but details are unclear from far away. Understanding: BASIC"

Dr. Synergy: "Interesting! SIGHT alone gives SOME information. But can we do better? Let's add another sense!"

**Step 2: Two-Sense Combination** "Press Button 2 to add SOUND power, then Button 4 to TEST again!"

Student actions:

- Press Button 2 → SOUND station glows yellow, battery shows 1/3
- Press Button 4 → TEST runs

**Result Animation:**

- Brain pathways light up (blue + yellow connecting)
- Performance Monitor shows significant improvement:
  - Performance: 85% ("Strong Understanding")
  - Information Quality: High (green)
  - Speed: Fast
  - Clarity: High
- Screen shows: "The Mind SEES the person AND HEARS their voice calling! Together, these senses recognize it's Jamie! Understanding: STRONG"
- **Special effect:** Synergy sparks between SIGHT and SOUND stations

Dr. Synergy: "Excellent! Look at that performance jump! When senses work as a TEAM, the Mind understands MORE, FASTER, and CLEARER! Now you're ready for real experiments!"

**Transition:** "Let's see how sensory teamwork helps in different situations!"

**Play**

**Game Structure:** 10 experimental challenges progressing from simple (2-sense comparisons) to complex (3-sense optimization)

**Core Mechanic:**

- Challenge scenario presented (situation requiring information)
- Students build sensory combination by pressing Buttons 1-3
- Students test combination with Button 4
- Mind Performance Monitor shows results (performance %, quality, speed, clarity)
- Students observe whether combination was optimal, good, or insufficient
- Opportunity to modify combination (add/remove senses) and retest
- Advance to next challenge with Button 5

**Scoring Based on Optimization:**

- **Optimal Combination:** Maximum appropriate senses for scenario = full points + bonus
- **Good Combination:** Functional but not optimal = partial points
- **Insufficient:** Too few senses for effective understanding = minimal points, retry encouraged
- **Over-optimization:** All 3 senses when only 1-2 needed = full points but no bonus (teaches efficiency)

**PHASE 1: TWO-SENSE DISCOVERIES (Challenges 1-4)**

**Goal:** Compare single-sense vs. two-sense combinations to observe teamwork advantage

**CHALLENGE 1: "Eating Lunch"**

**Scenario Display:**

- Animation: Child at table with sandwich
- Dr. Synergy: "The Mind wants to fully enjoy eating lunch. Which senses should work together?"

**Optimal Solution:** SIGHT + TOUCH (minimum functional), SIGHT + SOUND + TOUCH (full experience) **Accept as Good:** Any 2-sense combination including sight or touch

**Testing Process:**

Students build and test combinations:

**If SIGHT only (Button 1, then 4):**

- Performance: 35%
- Visual: Brain lights blue only
- Feedback: "The Mind sees the food looks good... but missing information about texture and temperature!"
- Points: 5 (insufficient)

**If SIGHT + TOUCH (Buttons 1, 3, then 4):**

- Performance: 75%
- Visual: Brain lights blue + green with connection
- Feedback: "Great teamwork! The Mind sees the sandwich AND feels its texture and warmth. Much better understanding!"
- Points: 15 (good combination)

**If SIGHT + SOUND + TOUCH (Buttons 1, 2, 3, then 4):**

- Performance: 95%
- Visual: All three colors light with interconnecting web
- Feedback: "EXCELLENT! The Mind sees the food, hears the crunch, AND feels the texture. FULL sensory experience!"
- Points: 25 (optimal + bonus)
- **Special Animation:** "SYNERGY BONUS!" flash, all stations pulse together

**If only SOUND:**

- Performance: 15%
- Feedback: "The Mind hears chewing sounds... but can't see what the food is or feel it. This sense needs teammates!"
- Points: 0, encouragement to add more senses

**Teaching Moment Display:** After testing: "DISCOVERY: Eating uses multiple senses working together! Each sense adds its own information."

**CHALLENGE 2: "Playing Catch"**

**Scenario Display:**

- Animation: Two children throwing ball back and forth
- Dr. Synergy: "The Mind needs to catch a ball successfully. Which senses make the best team?"

**Optimal Solution:** SIGHT + TOUCH (seeing ball trajectory + feeling catch) **Accept as Good:** SIGHT + SOUND + TOUCH

**Testing Process:**

**If SIGHT only:**

- Performance: 50%
- Feedback: "The Mind sees the ball coming... but without TOUCH to feel when hands close, catching is harder!"
- Points: 8

**If SIGHT + TOUCH:**

- Performance: 90%
- Feedback: "PERFECT TEAM! The Mind sees where the ball is AND feels the hands catching it. Success!"
- Points: 25 (optimal)
- Synergy animation

**If SIGHT + SOUND + TOUCH:**

- Performance: 92%
- Feedback: "Excellent! All three senses working. Hearing the ball whoosh adds a little extra information!"
- Points: 25 (optimal, no bonus - not more effective than 2-sense for this task)

**If TOUCH only:**

- Performance: 20%
- Feedback: "The Mind can feel hands moving, but can't SEE where the ball is. TOUCH needs SIGHT as a teammate here!"
- Points: 0, retry encouraged

**Teaching Moment:** "DISCOVERY: For sports, SIGHT and TOUCH are the main teammates. SOUND can help too!"

**CHALLENGE 3: "Watching a Movie"**

**Scenario Display:**

- Animation: Child sitting in front of screen with images and sound waves
- Dr. Synergy: "The Mind wants to enjoy and understand a movie. Which senses create the best experience?"

**Optimal Solution:** SIGHT + SOUND **Accept as Good:** SIGHT + SOUND + TOUCH (if considering controller vibration/theater rumble)

**Testing Process:**

**If SIGHT only:**

- Performance: 55%
- Feedback: "The Mind sees pictures moving... but without SOUND, it's missing dialogue, music, and effects. Like a silent movie!"
- Points: 8

**If SOUND only:**

- Performance: 40%
- Feedback: "The Mind hears voices and music... but can't SEE what's happening. Like listening to radio!"
- Points: 5

**If SIGHT + SOUND:**

- Performance: 95%
- Feedback: "PERFECT MOVIE TEAM! The Mind sees the story AND hears dialogue and music. Full understanding!"
- Points: 25 (optimal + bonus)
- Synergy animation: Movie screen glows

**If all three (SIGHT + SOUND + TOUCH):**

- Performance: 96%
- Feedback: "Excellent! SIGHT and SOUND are the main team. TOUCH adds a little (feeling the couch, or theater rumble)."
- Points: 25 (optimal, acknowledged but not higher than 2-sense)

**Teaching Moment:** "DISCOVERY: Movies are designed for SIGHT and SOUND teamwork! That's why silent movies felt incomplete."

**CHALLENGE 4: "Finding a Ringing Phone in Your Backpack"**

**Scenario Display:**

- Animation: Backpack with phone hidden inside, ringing sound waves
- Dr. Synergy: "Your phone is ringing but buried in your backpack. Which senses help find it fastest?"

## In-Class-Game 2D – Sensory Settings Lab

# **LESSON 4: People Experience Senses in Different Ways**

**Lesson Link & Learning Objective**: Students will recognize that people experience the same sensory input differently due to variations in sensitivity and preferences, will identify examples of sensory differences in themselves and classmates, and will demonstrate respect for differences by suggesting or accepting sensory accommodations.

**Game File Name: icg-02.04-game01.html**

**Game Title: Sensory Settings Lab**

**Game Format: Scenario Choices (Problem-Solving with Adaptive Solutions + Empathy Building)**

This format presents authentic social scenarios where students must diagnose individual sensory needs and design appropriate accommodations. Unlike simple matching games, students analyze characters' sensory profiles, consider multiple solution options, test their effectiveness, and receive feedback on how well they supported each person's unique needs. The adaptive element shows how the same environment can be adjusted to work for different sensory experiences.

**Purpose:** Students learn that sensory differences are normal variations requiring thoughtful accommodation, not problems to fix. By acting as "Sensory Support Specialists," students practice empathy, problem-solving, and understanding that what helps one person may differ from what helps another. This reinforces that psychology is the science of how minds work differently while building practical skills for inclusive environments.

**Lesson Placement:** Explore B section

**Timing:** Approximately 25-35 minutes into the 45-minute lesson (after Explore A on sensory differences and accommodations, video on neurodiversity, and "My Sensory Profile" self-assessment, before in-class quiz)

**Pedagogical Justification:** Students have just learned that sensory differences are real and normal (Explore A), seen the video validating diverse sensory experiences, and completed their own sensory profile assessment. They now understand that they themselves have sensory preferences. This placement allows them to apply that self-awareness to understanding and supporting others. By working through realistic scenarios requiring accommodation decisions, students bridge from "I have sensory preferences" to "Others have different preferences, and that's okay-here's how I can help." The game provides practice in empathy and problem-solving before the summative quiz, transforming abstract concepts of neurodiversity into concrete, actionable understanding.

**Setup**

**Opening Screen:** Students see **Dr. Synergy** (same character from Lesson 3, maintaining continuity for Lessons 3-4 arc) now wearing a tablet and standing in a "Sensory Settings Laboratory" with multiple environment stations visible in background.

**Scene Description:** Dr. Synergy stands in a modern, friendly lab with large screens showing different environments (classroom, playground, home, cafeteria). Three example characters are visible in waiting area:

**Character Profiles Displayed:**

- **Maya** (child with headphones around neck): Sensitive to loud sounds
- **Jordan** (child with textured clothing): Prefers soft fabrics, dislikes tags
- **Alex** (child wearing glasses): Needs bright light to see clearly

**Title Text:** "SENSORY SETTINGS LABORATORY - Everyone's Senses Work Differently!"

**Subtitle:** "Dr. Synergy needs your help! Each person experiences the world uniquely. Your job: Design the right settings so everyone can learn, play, and feel comfortable!"

**Key Message Display:** "Remember: Different is NOT wrong. Different is just... DIFFERENT! Our job is to help everyone's senses work well FOR THEM!"

**Clicker Instructions Display:**

- Buttons 1-4: Select accommodation solutions (varies by scenario)
- Button 5: TEST the solution (see if it helps)
- Button 6: TRY DIFFERENT solution (if first doesn't work)
- Button 7: NEXT person (after successfully helping current person)
- Button 8: "Why This?" explanation (shows reasoning for solutions)
- Button 9: "Sensory Science" notes (reminds about normal variations)

**Tutorial Sequence (Teacher-guided, 2 minutes):**

Dr. Synergy says: "Welcome back, Scientist! Yesterday you learned how senses work as a team. Today we're learning something equally important: everyone's sensory team has different SETTINGS!"

**Visual:** Three dials appear labeled "Sensitivity Level" - one set to high, one to medium, one to low.

"Just like you might prefer your music loud while your friend prefers it quiet, people's senses have different sensitivity settings. And that's NORMAL and OKAY!"

**Tutorial Scenario: "Classroom Lights - Maya's Need"**

**Screen Display:**

- Classroom scene with very bright overhead lights
- Maya character squinting, looking uncomfortable, hand over eyes
- Thought bubble: "These lights are too bright for me! My eyes hurt!"
- Sensory profile indicator: "MAYA - High sensitivity to bright light"

Dr. Synergy: "Maya's eyes are more sensitive to brightness than some other people's eyes. She needs help! What should we do?"

**Four Solution Options Appear:**

- "Tell Maya her eyes are broken and need to be fixed"
- "Let Maya sit away from the bright lights, or dim them"
- "Tell Maya to just ignore it"
- "Make everyone wear sunglasses"

Dr. Synergy: "Press the number of the BEST solution!"

**Correct Answer: Button 2**

**Student Action:**

- Press Button 2
- Press Button 5 to TEST

**Result Animation:**

- Maya moves to seat away from direct light
- Comfort meter rises from red (uncomfortable) to green (comfortable)
- Maya's expression changes to relaxed and smiling
- Checkmark appears

**Feedback Text:** "EXCELLENT! You understood that Maya's eyes aren't broken-they're just MORE SENSITIVE. Adjusting the environment helps her eyes work well! Maya can now focus on learning!"

**Points Display:** "+20 points - Perfect accommodation!"

**If Wrong Answer Selected (e.g., Button 1):**

- X appears
- Feedback: "Oops! Maya's eyes aren't broken-they're just different. Her sensitivity is NORMAL for her. Different doesn't mean broken! Try another solution."
- Allow retry with Button 6

**Dr. Synergy's Teaching Moment:** "Great work! You learned the golden rule: When someone's senses work differently, we don't TRY TO FIX THEM. We ADJUST THE ENVIRONMENT to help their senses work well. Now let's help more people!"

**Play**

**Game Structure:** 12 scenarios featuring 8 different characters with various sensory profiles, progressing from straightforward accommodations to complex problem-solving requiring multiple considerations.

**Core Mechanic:**

- Character introduced with sensory profile and specific challenge
- Visual/audio indicators show their discomfort or difficulty
- 3-4 solution options presented
- Students select solution (Buttons 1-4)
- Students test solution (Button 5)
- Comfort/success meter shows result
- Feedback explains why solution did/didn't work
- If incorrect, option to try different solution (Button 6)
- After success, brief reflection moment before next character (Button 7)

**Character Roster (8 unique children with different profiles):**

- **Maya** - High visual sensitivity (bright lights overwhelming)
- **Jordan** - High tactile sensitivity (certain textures uncomfortable)
- **Alex** - Low visual acuity (needs bright light and clear contrast)
- **Sam** - High auditory sensitivity (loud sounds overwhelming)
- **Riley** - Low auditory sensitivity (needs volume to hear clearly)
- **Casey** - Tactile-seeking (likes strong touch input)
- **Taylor** - Low visual sensitivity + high auditory sensitivity (combination)
- **Morgan** - Preference-based variation (no discomfort, just preference)

**Scoring Categories:**

- **Perfect Accommodation:** Optimal solution first try = 20-25 points
- **Good Accommodation:** Functional solution first try = 15 points
- **Eventually Successful:** Correct after retry = 10 points
- **Empathy Bonus:** Recognizing "different not broken" = +5 points
- **Efficiency Bonus:** Fast problem-solving (under 30 sec) = +3 points
- **Understanding Bonus:** Correct explanation of why solution works = +5 points

**ROUND 1: SINGLE SENSORY ACCOMMODATIONS (Scenarios 1-4)**

**Goal:** Identify individual sensory needs and select appropriate single accommodations

**SCENARIO 1: "Sam in Music Class"**

**Character Introduction:**

- Profile card appears: "SAM - High Auditory Sensitivity"
- Visual indicator: Sensitivity dial in "High" zone
- Dr. Synergy: "Sam's ears are more sensitive than some people's. Loud sounds feel MUCH louder to Sam!"

**Scene Display:**

- Music classroom with instruments, children playing
- Sam covering ears, looking distressed
- Sound wave symbols radiating (representing loud music)
- Comfort meter: RED (Very Uncomfortable)
- Thought bubble: "It's too loud! My ears hurt!"

**Problem Statement:** "Music class is fun for many students, but the volume is overwhelming for Sam's sensitive ears. How can we help Sam enjoy music class?"

**Solution Options:**

- "Sam should just get used to it and uncover ears"
- "Give Sam noise-reducing headphones or ear protection"
- "Make everyone play instruments very quietly"
- "Sam shouldn't participate in music class"

**Correct Answer: Button 2**

**Testing Process:** Student presses Button 2, then Button 5 (TEST)

**Success Animation:**

- Sam puts on noise-reducing headphones
- Sound wave symbols reduce to gentle waves
- Comfort meter rises from red → yellow → green
- Sam's expression changes: distressed → neutral → smiling
- Sam begins tapping foot to music, participating happily
- Checkmark and sparkle effect

**Feedback:** "PERFECT ACCOMMODATION! The noise-reducing headphones lower the volume to a comfortable level FOR SAM. Sam's ears work differently-they hear more intensely-so this tool helps them work well! Sam can now enjoy music class!"

**Points:** 20 points + 5 Empathy Bonus

**Dr. Synergy's Note:** "Important science: Some people's auditory systems are MORE SENSITIVE. Tools like headphones don't fix anything-they adjust the INPUT to match the person's needs!"

**If Wrong Answer:**

- **Button 1:** "That's not helpful! Sam's sensitivity won't change by forcing it. Sam's ears are NORMAL for Sam-the environment needs adjusting, not Sam!"
- **Button 3:** "That's thoughtful, but not fair to everyone else. We can help Sam WITHOUT changing things for everyone!"
- **Button 4:** "No! Sam deserves to participate! We just need the right accommodation!"

**Retry Option:** Button 6 allows selecting different solution (reduced points)

**SCENARIO 2: "Alex Reading at the Board"**

**Character Introduction:**

- Profile card: "ALEX - Low Visual Acuity (wears glasses, needs bright light)"
- Visual indicator: Brightness need in "High" zone
- Dr. Synergy: "Alex's eyes need MORE light to see clearly. Dim lighting makes reading very hard!"

**Scene Display:**

- Classroom with board at front, overhead lights dim
- Alex squinting at board, leaning forward, struggling
- Board text appears blurry from Alex's perspective
- Comfort meter: RED (Cannot see clearly)
- Thought bubble: "I can't read the board! The light's too dim!"

**Problem Statement:** "Alex is trying to read the lesson on the board, but the dim lighting makes it impossible to see clearly. How can we help?"

**Solution Options:**

- "Tell Alex to move closer to the board"
- "Turn on brighter lights or give Alex a desk lamp"
- "Tell Alex to try harder to see"
- "Write bigger letters on the board"

\*\*Correct Answer: Button 2 (primary), Button 1 (also acceptable)

**Testing Process:** Student selects solution and tests

**Success Animation (Button 2):**

- Lights brighten in Alex's area
- Board comes into clear focus (visual effect showing clarity)
- Alex's eyes widen, expression becomes pleased
- Comfort meter rises to green
- Alex begins reading and taking notes
- Checkmark appears

**Feedback:** "EXCELLENT! You understood that Alex's eyes need MORE light to process visual information clearly. Brighter lighting helps Alex's visual system work at its best! This is a perfect accommodation!"

**Points:** 25 points + 5 Empathy Bonus + 5 Understanding Bonus

**Alternative Success (Button 1):**

- Alex moves to front row
- Board appears clearer from close distance
- Comfort meter rises to yellow-green (improved but not optimal)
- Feedback: "Good thinking! Moving closer helps. Even better would be ALSO adding more light. But this is a functional solution!"
- Points: 15 points

**Dr. Synergy's Note:** "Science fact: Some visual systems need MORE light input, some need LESS. Alex's need for brightness is just as normal as Maya's need for less. Different settings, both normal!"

**SCENARIO 3: "Jordan's Scratchy Shirt Tag"**

**Character Introduction:**

- Profile card: "JORDAN - High Tactile Sensitivity"
- Visual indicator: Touch sensitivity in "High" zone
- Dr. Synergy: "Jordan's skin is very sensitive to textures. What feels like a small scratch to some people feels much more intense to Jordan!"

**Scene Display:**

- Jordan at desk, fidgeting uncomfortably
- Close-up shows shirt tag rubbing against neck (visual indicator: red irritation spot)
- Jordan repeatedly touching/pulling at shirt collar
- Comfort meter: RED (Very Uncomfortable)
- Thought bubble: "This tag is so scratchy! I can't focus on anything else!"

**Problem Statement:** "Jordan is having trouble concentrating because the shirt tag feels very uncomfortable. How can we help Jordan feel better?"

**Solution Options:**

- "Tell Jordan to ignore it-it's just a tag"
- "Help Jordan cut out the tag or change to tagless clothing"
- "Tell Jordan to wear the shirt inside-out"
- "Give Jordan a rough shirt to wear so they get used to it"

\*\*Correct Answer: Button 2 (best), Button 3 (acceptable alternative)

**Testing Process:**

**Success Animation (Button 2):**

- Tag removal animation (scissors cutting)
- Red irritation spot fades
- Jordan's posture relaxes immediately
- Comfort meter rises to green
- Jordan smiles, begins focusing on work
- Relief expression clear

**Feedback:** "PERFECT SOLUTION! You understood that Jordan's tactile sensitivity makes certain textures genuinely uncomfortable-not just annoying. Removing the tag respects Jordan's sensory needs! Jordan can now focus on learning instead of being distracted by discomfort!"

**Points:** 20 points + 5 Empathy Bonus

**Alternative Success (Button 3):**

- Jordan turns shirt inside-out
- Tag now on outside, away from skin
- Comfort meter rises to green
- Feedback: "Creative solution! The tag isn't touching Jordan's sensitive skin anymore. Nice problem-solving!"
- Points: 20 points

**If Wrong Answer (Button 1 or 4):**

- Feedback: "That won't help! Jordan's sensitivity is REAL, not imaginary. We should respect it and make adjustments, not ask Jordan to suffer through it!"

**Dr. Synergy's Note:** "Remember: Sensory sensitivity isn't 'being fussy.' It's how a person's nervous system processes touch information. Jordan's experience is VALID!"

**SCENARIO 4: "Riley in Quiet Library"**

**Character Introduction:**

- Profile card: "RILEY - Low Auditory Sensitivity (needs higher volume to hear clearly)"
- Visual indicator: Hearing sensitivity in "Low" zone
- Dr. Synergy: "Riley's ears don't pick up quiet sounds as easily as some people's ears. Riley needs MORE volume to hear well!"

**Scene Display:**

- Library scene with other children reading quietly
- Teacher speaking softly to group
- Riley leaning forward, hand cupped to ear, confused expression
- Sound waves shown as very faint
- Comprehension meter: RED (Missing information)
- Thought bubble: "What did the teacher say? I can't hear!"

**Problem Statement:** "The teacher is giving quiet instructions in the library, but Riley can't hear them clearly. How can we help Riley receive the information?"

**Solution Options:**

- "Tell Riley to pay better attention"
- "Let Riley sit closer to the teacher or use a hearing assistance device"
- "Make everyone in the library talk louder"
- "Just give Riley written instructions instead"

\*\*Correct Answer: Button 2 (best), Button 4 (acceptable)

**Testing Process:**

**Success Animation (Button 2):**

- Riley moves to front of group (closer to teacher)
- Sound waves become clearer and stronger from Riley's perspective
- Riley's confused expression changes to understanding
- Comprehension meter rises to green
- Riley nods, begins following instructions
- Checkmark appears

**Feedback:** "EXCELLENT ACCOMMODATION! You recognized that Riley's auditory system needs STRONGER input to process speech clearly. Sitting closer or using amplification helps Riley hear what others hear easily! Perfect understanding of how to support different sensory needs!"

**Points:** 25 points + 5 Empathy Bonus + 5 Understanding Bonus

**Alternative Success (Button 4):**

- Riley receives written card with instructions
- Riley reads card, understanding is clear
- Comprehension meter rises to green
- Feedback: "Good alternative! Written information ensures Riley doesn't miss anything. This respects that Riley's auditory processing works differently!"
- Points: 20 points

**Dr. Synergy's Note:** "Key learning: Just as some people need LESS sensory input (Maya with light, Sam with sound), others need MORE (Alex with light, Riley with sound). Both are normal variations!"

**ROUND 1 COMPLETION SCREEN:** "ROUND 1 COMPLETE! You helped 4 people with different sensory needs!"

**Stats Display:**

- "Perfect Accommodations: \[X\]/4"
- "Empathy Bonuses Earned: \[X\]"
- "Total Points: \[XXX\]"

**Dr. Synergy's Message:** "Great work! You're learning to see that when people experience senses differently, they're not wrong or broken-they just need different environmental settings. Now let's try harder challenges!"

**ROUND 2: COMPLEX ACCOMMODATIONS & MULTIPLE NEEDS (Scenarios 5-8)**

**Goal:** Navigate situations requiring more nuanced problem-solving, multiple accommodations, or balancing different needs

**SCENARIO 5: "Casey Needs Movement Input"**

**Character Introduction:**

- Profile card: "CASEY - Tactile-Seeking (needs strong touch/movement input for focus)"
- Visual indicator: Sensory input need in "High" zone
- Dr. Synergy: "Casey's sensory system needs MORE input to feel regulated. Movement and touch help Casey's brain focus!"

**Scene Display:**

- Classroom during reading time, children sitting still
- Casey fidgeting constantly, squirming in chair, tapping desk
- Other students looking annoyed at the movement
- Focus meter: RED (Difficulty concentrating)
- Thought bubble: "I need to move! Sitting still makes it harder to think!"

**Problem Statement:** "Casey needs to move and get sensory input to concentrate, but the fidgeting is distracting others. How can we help Casey AND the class?"

**Solution Options:**

- "Tell Casey to sit completely still like everyone else"
- "Give Casey a fidget tool, movement break, or standing desk option"
- "Send Casey out of the classroom"
- "Let Casey run around the classroom during lessons"

**Correct Answer: Button 2**

**Testing Process:**

**Success Animation:**

- Casey receives fidget spinner/stress ball
- Casey uses tool quietly while listening
- Movement is contained and quiet
- Focus meter rises from red → yellow → green
- Casey's expression becomes calm and attentive
- Other students continue working undisturbed
- Checkmark with "Win-Win Solution" banner

**Feedback:** "PERFECT PROBLEM-SOLVING! You understood that Casey NEEDS sensory input-it's not misbehavior, it's how Casey's system regulates! The fidget tool provides the input Casey needs while respecting others' needs for quiet. Everyone wins!"

**Points:** 25 points + 5 Empathy Bonus + 5 Problem-Solving Bonus

**Dr. Synergy's Note:** "Important: Some nervous systems need MORE sensory input to focus (tactile-seeking). Others need LESS (sensitive). Both are normal! The key is finding accommodations that work for everyone!"

**If Wrong Answer:**

- **Button 1:** "That won't work! Casey's need for movement is REAL and neurological. Forcing stillness makes concentration HARDER for Casey, not easier!"
- **Button 3:** "No! Casey deserves to learn with everyone! We just need the right accommodation!"
- **Button 4:** "That would be too disruptive to others. We need a solution that helps Casey AND respects everyone else's needs!"

**SCENARIO 6: "Taylor's Combined Needs (Multi-Sensory Challenge)"**

**Character Introduction:**

- Profile card: "TAYLOR - Low Visual Sensitivity (needs bright light) + High Auditory Sensitivity (needs quiet)"
- Visual indicator: Two dials shown-brightness HIGH, sound LOW
- Dr. Synergy: "Challenge! Taylor has TWO different sensory needs. We need to accommodate BOTH!"

**Scene Display:**

- Classroom with medium lighting and moderate noise
- Taylor squinting at book (needs more light) AND covering one ear (too loud)
- Dual comfort meters:
  - Vision comfort: YELLOW (struggling to see)
  - Hearing comfort: YELLOW (too loud)
- Thought bubble: "I need brighter light to read, but it's also too noisy in here!"

**Problem Statement:** "Taylor needs MORE light for reading but LESS noise for concentration. How can we help with BOTH needs at once?"

**Solution Options:**

- "Give Taylor a desk lamp + noise-reducing headphones"
- "Only fix one problem-the light OR the sound"
- "Move Taylor to a brighter but louder area"
- "Tell Taylor to choose which sense matters more"

**Correct Answer: Button 1**

**Testing Process:**

**Success Animation:**

- Taylor receives desk lamp (bright light on book)
- Vision comfort meter rises to green
- Taylor puts on noise-reducing headphones
- Hearing comfort meter rises to green
- BOTH meters green simultaneously
- Taylor's expression: relieved and focused
- Double checkmark appears
- "Complete Accommodation!" banner

**Feedback:** "BRILLIANT! You understood that people can have MULTIPLE sensory needs that seem opposite! Taylor needs MORE of one input (light) and LESS of another (sound). Using TWO accommodations helps BOTH of Taylor's sensory systems work well together! This is expert-level problem-solving!"

**Points:** 30 points + 5 Empathy Bonus + 10 Complex Problem-Solving Bonus

**Dr. Synergy's Note:** "Advanced learning: People aren't just 'sensitive' or 'not sensitive'-each sense can have its own settings! Taylor shows that sensory profiles can be complex. That's why we ask people what THEY need instead of assuming!"

**If Wrong Answer:**

- **Button 2 or 4:** "Not quite! Taylor needs help with BOTH senses, not just one. We shouldn't make Taylor choose-we should support both needs!"
- **Button 3:** "That makes one problem better but the other worse! We need a solution that helps BOTH of Taylor's sensory needs!"

**SCENARIO 7: "Morgan's Preference (Not Discomfort)"**

**Character Introduction:**

- Profile card: "MORGAN - Preference-Based Variation (no discomfort, just likes certain settings)"
- Visual indicator: Preference dial in "Personal Choice" zone (not sensitivity issue)
- Dr. Synergy: "Important distinction! Morgan doesn't have high sensitivity-Morgan just PREFERS certain settings. This is also valid!"

**Scene Display:**

- Art room with two seating options visible
- Option A: Table near window with natural light and soft background music
- Option B: Table in center with bright overhead lights and quiet
- Morgan looking at both options, thinking
- No discomfort indicators present
- Thought bubble: "I like working with natural light and a little background sound. It just feels nicer to me!"

**Problem Statement:** "Morgan doesn't NEED a specific accommodation for sensory sensitivity, but PREFERS certain environmental settings for comfort and enjoyment. Should we honor Morgan's preference?"

**Solution Options:**

- "No-preferences don't matter, only medical needs do"
- "Yes-let Morgan choose the preferred setting when possible"
- "Tell Morgan to work wherever assigned"
- "Make everyone use Morgan's preferred setting"

**Correct Answer: Button 2**

**Testing Process:**

**Success Animation:**

- Morgan chooses Option A (window seat)
- Morgan settles in comfortably
- Enjoyment meter (not discomfort meter) rises to green
- Morgan begins working happily and productively
- Smile indicates contentment
- "Preference Respected!" banner

**Feedback:** "THOUGHTFUL RESPONSE! You understood an important distinction: Not all sensory differences are about sensitivity or discomfort. Sometimes people just have PREFERENCES-and those are valid too! When we can honor preferences without disrupting others, we should! Everyone works better when comfortable!"

**Points:** 20 points + 10 Nuance Understanding Bonus

**Dr. Synergy's Teaching Moment:** "Critical thinking: There's a spectrum!

- Some people have HIGH SENSITIVITY (need accommodation for comfort/function)
- Some people have LOW SENSITIVITY (need accommodation for access)
- Some people have PREFERENCES (would like certain settings when possible) ALL are valid! ALL deserve respect!"

**If Wrong Answer:**

- **Button 1:** "Not quite! While medical needs are important, respecting preferences ALSO matters when feasible. Making people comfortable helps everyone!"
- **Button 3:** "That's rigid! When we CAN honor preferences without problems, why wouldn't we? Respecting preferences builds inclusive communities!"

**SCENARIO 8: "Conflict Resolution - Sam & Riley Together"**

**Character Introduction:**

- Profile cards: Both "SAM - High Auditory Sensitivity" and "RILEY - Low Auditory Sensitivity"
- Visual: Two characters need to work together on project
- Dr. Synergy: "CHALLENGE! Sam needs it QUIET. Riley needs it LOUDER. How can we help them BOTH?"

**Scene Display:**

- Two desks pushed together for partner work
- Sam with hands over ears (classroom noise too loud)
- Riley leaning forward, straining to hear partner's voice (needs volume)
- Dual comfort meters:
  - Sam's comfort: RED (too loud)
  - Riley's comprehension: RED (too quiet)
- Conflict indicator: "Opposite Needs!"
- Thought bubbles:
  - Sam: "It's too loud! I can't think!"
  - Riley: "I can't hear what we're supposed to do!"

**Problem Statement:** "Sam and Riley need to work together, but they have OPPOSITE auditory needs. How can we help them BOTH succeed?"

**Solution Options:**

- "Give Sam noise-reducing headphones + Give Riley a personal amplifier or microphone"
- "Keep Sam and Riley apart-they can't work together"
- "Tell them to compromise and both be uncomfortable"
- "Only help one person-whoever needs it more"

**Correct Answer: Button 1**

**Testing Process:**

**Feedback:** "EXPERT PROBLEM-SOLVING! You found a creative solution that helps BOTH children with their OPPOSITE needs! Sam's noise-reducing headphones lower the distracting sounds while Riley's amplifier makes the important sounds (partner's voice) loud enough. This is the BEST kind of accommodation-one that respects that different people need different things, and finds ways to make it work for EVERYONE!"

**Points:** 35 points + 5 Empathy Bonus + 15 Advanced Problem-Solving Bonus + 10 Inclusion Bonus

**Dr. Synergy's Major Teaching Moment:** "THIS is the heart of understanding sensory differences!

- People's needs can be OPPOSITE
- That doesn't mean one person is right and one is wrong
- BOTH experiences are valid
- Creative accommodations can help EVERYONE
- Inclusion means finding solutions, not choosing sides!

This is how we build communities where everyone belongs!"

**If Wrong Answer:**

- **Button 2:** "No! Different needs don't mean people can't work together. We just need creative accommodations!"
- **Button 3:** "Never! We don't make people uncomfortable when we can find better solutions. Both needs deserve respect!"
- **Button 4:** "Not fair! Both Sam and Riley's sensory experiences are equally valid. We should help BOTH!"

**ROUND 2 COMPLETION SCREEN:** "ROUND 2 COMPLETE! You mastered complex sensory accommodation challenges!"

**Stats Display:**

**SCENARIO 9: "Classroom Design Challenge"**

**Scene Display:**

- Empty classroom layout shown from above
- Must place 6 characters (Maya, Jordan, Alex, Sam, Riley, Casey) in optimal locations
- Various features labeled: windows (bright light), quiet corner, middle area, near speakers, textured rug area, movement zone

**Problem Statement:** "You're helping design classroom seating! Each child has different sensory needs. Where should each person sit to help their senses work best?"

**This is a MATCHING challenge - students assign seats:**

**Characters to Place:**

- Maya (high visual sensitivity) - needs dimmer area
- Alex (low visual acuity) - needs bright area
- Sam (high auditory sensitivity) - needs quiet area
- Riley (low auditory sensitivity) - needs area near teacher/sound
- Jordan (tactile sensitivity) - needs smooth surfaces
- Casey (tactile-seeking) - needs access to movement

**Clicker Mechanic:**

- Multiple rounds: "Where should Maya sit? 1=Window 2=Quiet Corner 3=Middle 4=Back Away from Lights"
- Repeat for each character
- After all placed, Button 5 to TEST arrangement

**Optimal Arrangement:**

- Maya: Back/side, away from bright lights (Button 4 correct)
- Alex: Near window or under bright light (Button 1 correct)
- Sam: Quiet corner away from noise (Button 2 correct)
- Riley: Front/center near teacher (Button 3 correct)

- Casey: Near movement zone/back where fidgeting less disruptive

**Success Animation:**

- All 6 characters appear in their assigned seats
- Comfort meters for all show green
- Classroom glows with harmony
- "Inclusive Classroom Designed!" banner
- All children shown working happily

**Feedback:** "BRILLIANT CLASSROOM DESIGN! You remembered each person's specific sensory profile and found spots where everyone's senses can work well! This is how we create truly inclusive spaces-by thinking about everyone's needs from the START, not as an afterthought!"

**Points:** 40 points + 10 Application Bonus + 10 Inclusivity Bonus

**If Some Placements Wrong:**

- Shows which placements don't match needs
- Explains why (e.g., "Maya is under bright light-that would be uncomfortable for her sensitive eyes")
- Allows repositioning with Button 6
- Reduced points but still acknowledges effort

**Dr. Synergy's Note:** "Real-world application! When we PLAN for sensory diversity from the beginning, everyone benefits! This is called 'Universal Design'-designing spaces that work for people with different needs!"

**SCENARIO 10: "Self-Advocacy Teaching"**

**Scene Display:**

- New character: "Jamie" (no profile given yet)
- Jamie looks uncomfortable but hasn't said anything
- Classroom is moderately bright and moderately loud
- Thought bubble empty-Jamie's needs aren't obvious

**Problem Statement:** "Jamie looks uncomfortable but hasn't told anyone what's wrong. What should we do to help Jamie?"

**Solution Options:**

- "Ask Jamie: 'What do your senses need right now? How can we help?'"
- "Guess what Jamie needs and make changes without asking"
- "Ignore it-if Jamie needed help, Jamie would ask"
- "Assume Jamie has the same needs as someone else we know"

**Correct Answer: Button 1**

**Testing Process:**

**Success Animation:**

- Teacher approaches Jamie kindly
- Speech bubble: "Jamie, I notice you seem uncomfortable. What do your senses need? Is it too

bright? Too loud? Something else?"

- Jamie's thought bubble appears: "The chair feels really hard and uncomfortable. Could I have a cushion?"
- Teacher provides cushion
- Jamie's expression changes to relieved and comfortable
- Comfort meter rises to green
- "Self-Advocacy Supported!" banner

**Feedback:** "PERFECT APPROACH! You understood the most important principle: ASK people what THEY need! We can't always guess someone's sensory needs by looking. Everyone's experience is unique. By asking Jamie directly, we:

- Showed respect for Jamie's own knowledge of their senses
- Got accurate information instead of guessing
- Taught Jamie that self-advocacy is OKAY and encouraged
- Learned something new-Jamie's need was different than we might have guessed!

This is how we truly support sensory diversity!"

**Points:** 30 points + 15 Self-Advocacy Bonus + 10 Communication Bonus

**Dr. Synergy's Major Teaching Moment:** "CRITICAL LESSON: The best accommodation expert is THE PERSON THEMSELVES!

- Don't assume you know what someone needs
- Don't guess based on how they look
- Don't apply someone else's profile to them
- DO ask them directly: 'What do you need?'
- DO listen to their answer
- DO respect their knowledge of their own body

Self-advocacy is a SKILL we should teach and encourage!"

**If Wrong Answer:**

- **Button 2:** "Not best practice! Guessing can lead to wrong accommodations. ASKING respects Jamie's expertise about their own senses!"
- **Button 3:** "Many people, especially kids, don't know it's okay to ask for help! We should create environments where self-advocacy is welcomed!"
- **Button 4:** "Dangerous assumption! Every person's sensory profile is UNIQUE. Never assume based on how someone looks or someone else's needs!"

**SCENARIO 11: "Tool Stigma Challenge"**

**Scene Display:**

- Playground scene during recess
- Sam wearing noise-reducing headphones
- Two other children pointing and whispering
- Speech bubble from other kids: "Why is Sam wearing those? That's weird!"
- Sam looking self-conscious, starting to remove headphones
- Thought bubble from Sam: "Maybe I shouldn't use these... everyone's staring..."

**Problem Statement:** "Sam's noise-reducing headphones help Sam's sensitive ears, but some kids are making Sam feel weird about using them. What's the BEST response?"

**Solution Options:**

- "Tell Sam to take off the headphones so no one thinks Sam is different"
- "Teach everyone that sensory tools are NORMAL and HELPFUL, not weird"
- "Tell the other kids to stop being mean but don't explain why"
- "Separate Sam from other kids to avoid comments"

**Correct Answer: Button 2**

**Testing Process:**

**Success Animation (Multi-Scene):**

Scene 1: Teacher gathers group

- Teacher: "Let's learn about sensory tools! Does anyone wear glasses?"
- Several hands raise
- Teacher: "Glasses help eyes that need support. Sam's headphones help ears that need support. Both are tools that help our senses work well!"

Scene 2: Understanding spreads

- Children's expressions change from confused to understanding
- One child: "Oh! Like my glasses! That makes sense!"
- Another child: "That's actually cool! Can I try them?"

Scene 3: Acceptance

- Sam confident again, wearing headphones comfortably
- Other kids playing nearby, accepting
- Sam joins game happily
- "Stigma Reduced - Understanding Increased!" banner
- Multiple checkmarks

**Feedback:** "OUTSTANDING ADVOCACY! You understood that the problem wasn't Sam's tool-it was other people's lack of understanding! By EDUCATING everyone, you:

- Helped Sam feel comfortable using needed tools
- Taught others that sensory accommodations are normal
- Made the environment more inclusive for EVERYONE
- Reduced stigma through knowledge

Education changes attitudes! When people understand WHY someone uses a tool, curiosity replaces judgment!"

**Points:** 35 points + 15 Advocacy Bonus + 10 Education Bonus + 10 Stigma-Reduction Bonus

**Dr. Synergy's Critical Teaching:** "IMPORTANT REAL-WORLD LESSON:

- Sensory tools (headphones, fidgets, sunglasses, weighted items) are ACCOMMODATIONS, not weird
- Just like glasses, wheelchairs, or hearing aids-they help people's bodies work well
- Using tools shows STRENGTH and self-awareness, not weakness
- The solution to stigma is EDUCATION
- Standing up for others' right to accommodations makes communities better

Never let someone feel bad for using tools they need!"

**If Wrong Answer:**

- **Button 1:** "NO! Never remove needed accommodations because of others' reactions! Sam's hearing health matters more than others' opinions!"
- **Button 3:** "That helps short-term but doesn't address the root cause-lack of understanding. Education prevents future issues!"
- **Button 4:** "That's exclusion, not inclusion! Sam deserves to play with friends while using needed tools!"

**SCENARIO 12: "FINAL CHALLENGE - Party Planning for Everyone"**

**Scene Display:**

- Birthday party planning scene

**Correct: Button 3**

**Decision 3: Activity Options** "What activities should you include?"

- Only active/movement games
- Only quiet/still games
- Variety: active games + quiet games + creative stations
- Whatever the birthday child likes

**Correct: Button 3**

**Decision 4: Seating Arrangement** "How should seating work?"

- Assigned seats (no choices)
- First-come seating
- Multiple seating options: cushioned chairs, hard chairs, standing tables, floor cushions
- Everyone sits the same way

**Correct: Button 3**

**Decision 5: Food Considerations** "What about food textures?"

- Only smooth foods
- Only crunchy foods
- Variety of textures + clear labels so people can choose
- Everyone eats the same thing

**Correct: Button 3**

**Testing Process:** After all decisions made, Button 5 to TEST party plan

**Success Animation (Epic Finale):**

**Scene transforms into party in action:**

- Music plays at moderate volume
- Sam wearing headphones, dancing happily
- Riley near speaker, hearing clearly, also dancing
- Bright area with Alex reading birthday card clearly

**Celebration sequence:**

- "INCLUSIVE PARTY SUCCESS!" banner
- Confetti explosion
- All characters give thumbs up
- Party lights flash in celebration
- Rainbow effect across screen

**Feedback:** "MASTERFUL INCLUSIVE DESIGN! You created a party where EVERY child can participate comfortably! Your key insight: CHOICE and VARIETY!

Instead of making ONE setting for everyone (which never works), you provided: ✓ Options at different volumes ✓ Spaces with different lighting ✓ Activities for different energy levels ✓ Seating for different comfort needs ✓ Food choices for different textures

This is UNIVERSAL DESIGN-creating environments where people with diverse needs can all participate fully!

You've learned the most important lesson: Different isn't wrong. Different is NORMAL. And when we plan for diversity, EVERYONE benefits!"

**Points:** 60 points + 20 Universal Design Bonus + 15 Inclusion Mastery Bonus + 10 Empathy Bonus

**All 8 Character Testimonials appear:**

- Sam: "My headphones helped me enjoy the music!"
- Riley: "I heard all the games and could join in!"
- Casey: "I had space to move and fidget!"
- Taylor: "I got light AND quiet when I needed them!"
- Morgan: "I chose my favorite spot!"

**Dr. Synergy's Final Message:** "You did it! You mastered sensory accommodation! You understand:

- Sensory differences are NORMAL
- Different people need different settings
- We ASK people what they need
- We provide CHOICES and OPTIONS
- We EDUCATE to reduce stigma
- We design for EVERYONE from the start

This is how we build truly inclusive communities where everyone belongs!"

- Replay specific scenarios for teaching moments
- Skip to specific rounds if time constrained
- "Discussion mode" that pauses for class debate before showing answer
- Highlight specific learning objectives achieved

**Continuity Note**

**Connection to Lessons 1-3:**

- **Lesson 1:** Senses as doorways → now understanding that different people have different-sized doorways (sensitivity variations)
- **Lesson 2:** Each sense provides unique information → now understanding that people receive that information with different intensity/clarity
- **Lesson 3:** Senses work as teams → now understanding that people's sensory "teams" have different configurations and needs
- **Complete Unit Arc:** From basic sensory function → specialization → integration → individual variation and accommodation

**Character Continuity:**

- Dr. Synergy returns from Lesson 3, completing the Lessons 3-4 narrative arc focused on teamwork and diversity
- All characters introduced here (Maya, Jordan, Alex, Sam, Riley, Casey, Taylor, Morgan) represent the unit's culmination: real children with diverse sensory profiles that students now understand scientifically
- Cameo appearance of previous characters (Kimi, V.J., Echo, Tex) in victory celebration, uniting entire unit's journey

**Metaphor Evolution Complete:**

- Lesson 1: Senses as doorways (entry points)
- Lesson 2: Senses as specialized reporters (unique roles)
- Lesson 3: Senses as team members with synergy (integration)
- Lesson 4: Teams with different configurations (variations requiring accommodation)

**Unit Closure:** This final game synthesizes all unit learning-students apply their understanding of sensory doorways, specialization, and integration to the real-world application of supporting diverse sensory experiences. The unit ends with students not just understanding the science of sensation but also developing empathy, problem-solving skills, and commitment to inclusion.

**Bridge to Future Learning:** Sets foundation for understanding that minds work differently across many domains (not just senses), preparing for future psychology topics about thinking differences, emotional variations, and cognitive diversity.
