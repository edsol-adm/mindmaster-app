## Home Game 3A – Sensory Pattern Master
> Jump to: [Setup](#setup) · [Play](#play) · [Scoring](#scoring) · [Win Condition](#win-condition) · [Continuity Note](#continuity-note)

### Learning Objective
Students will demonstrate how the mind combines information from multiple senses to create fuller understanding, and will explain that multisensory teamwork makes tasks easier and clearer.

### Game File Name & Format
`hg-02.03-01.html` — Simon Says / Repeat the Pattern — Memory and pattern recognition game where players must remember and reproduce sequences that combine visual, auditory, and tactile cues, demonstrating that multisensory information creates stronger memory.

### Game Purpose
This game proves through direct experience that combining multiple senses strengthens memory and understanding. Players discover that patterns using sight+sound+touch are easier to remember than patterns using only one sense, reinforcing the power of multisensory integration.

### Estimated Play Time
7–9 minutes (approximately 1–2 minutes per level, 9 patterns total plus bonus challenge)

### Setup
Player sees a game board with three rows of colorful buttons:

- **Top row (Visual):** 4 colored shape buttons (red circle, blue square, green triangle, yellow star)  
- **Middle row (Auditory):** 4 sound buttons with icons (bell, drum, whistle, chime)  
- **Bottom row (Tactile):** 4 texture buttons with patterns (smooth, bumpy, soft, rough)  

Above the board is a demonstration area where the computer will show patterns.

Text prompt: *"Watch and listen carefully! Then repeat the pattern by tapping the buttons in the same order."*

A difficulty selector appears: *"Choose your challenge:"*

- **Level 1:** Visual patterns only (3–4 buttons)  
- **Level 2:** Visual + Auditory patterns (3–4 buttons)  
- **Level 3:** All three senses combined (4–5 buttons)  

A **Return to Home Games** button appears in the top-right corner, linking back to `hg-02.03.html`.

### Play
Step-by-step gameplay:

#### LEVEL 1: Single Sense (Visual Only)
- **Pattern demonstration:** Computer highlights buttons in sequence (e.g., red circle → blue square → green triangle). Each button glows when highlighted.  
- **Memory challenge:** Player watches the pattern (no audio, no tactile cues).  
- **Player reproduction:** Player must tap the same buttons in the same order.  
- **Feedback:**  
  - Correct: Pattern turns gold, success chime plays. Text: *"You remembered the visual pattern! Now let's try adding sound..."*  
  - Incorrect: Pattern flashes red. Text: *"Not quite. Watch again."* Pattern repeats.  
- **Progression:** Complete 3 visual-only patterns (increasing from 3 to 4 buttons).  

#### LEVEL 2: Two Senses (Visual + Auditory)
- **Pattern demonstration:** Computer shows sequence with BOTH visual highlighting AND sound playing (e.g., red circle glows + bell sound → blue square glows + drum sound → green triangle glows + whistle sound).  
- **Memory challenge:** Player experiences pattern through two senses simultaneously.  
- **Player reproduction:** Player taps buttons in correct order (both visual and auditory feedback confirm).  
- **Feedback:**  
  - Correct: Text: *"Great! Did you notice the pattern was easier to remember with sight AND sound working together?"*  
  - Incorrect: Pattern repeats with both cues.  
- **Progression:** Complete 3 audiovisual patterns (4 buttons each).  

#### LEVEL 3: Three Senses (Visual + Auditory + Tactile)
- **Pattern demonstration:** Computer shows sequence with ALL THREE sensory cues:  
  - **Visual:** Button glows  
  - **Auditory:** Sound plays  
  - **Tactile:** Texture pattern appears (represented by animated texture overlay on button — smooth ripple, bumpy vibration effect, soft pulse, rough shake)  
- **Memory challenge:** Player experiences richest multisensory pattern.  
- **Player reproduction:** Player taps buttons, experiencing all three sensory feedbacks.  
- **Feedback:**  
  - Correct: Confetti burst. Text: *"Amazing! Using all three senses together makes remembering even easier. The mind combines sight, sound, and touch to create the strongest memory!"*  
  - Incorrect: Full multisensory pattern repeats.  
- **Progression:** Complete 3 multisensory patterns (4–5 buttons each).  

#### BONUS CHALLENGE
After completing all levels, player is shown a comparison:

- *"Try to remember this 5-button pattern with ONLY sight..."* (player attempts)  
- *"Now try this 5-button pattern with ALL THREE senses..."* (player attempts)  

Game displays success rate comparison, demonstrating that multisensory patterns are remembered more accurately.  

### Scoring
- **Points earned:**  
  - Level 1 (visual only): 1 point per correct pattern  
  - Level 2 (visual + auditory): 2 points per correct pattern  
  - Level 3 (all three senses): 3 points per correct pattern  
  - Bonus challenge: 5 points if multisensory pattern remembered better than single-sense  
- **Pattern Master Badge:** Complete all three levels without mistakes = earn *“Sensory Pattern Master”* badge  
- **Total possible:** 24 points (3+6+9+5+bonus), 1 Pattern Master Badge  

### Win Condition
Player completes the game by successfully reproducing all patterns across all three levels and completing the bonus challenge. Final screen displays:

- Total points earned  
- Pattern Master Badge (if earned)  
- Comparison chart: *"Your memory accuracy by number of senses used"* (visual bar graph showing performance improves with more senses)  
- Summary message: *"You discovered the power of sensory teamwork! When your EYES, EARS, and HANDS work together, the mind remembers better and understands more clearly. Multiple senses create stronger, fuller information than any single sense alone."*  
- Button options: “Play Again” or “Return to Home Games”

### Continuity Note
This game provides experiential proof of Lesson 3's core principle: multisensory integration creates stronger understanding. By directly comparing single-sense versus multisensory memory performance, players discover through their own experience that teamwork among senses produces better results. This prepares them for Game 3B, which explores how senses compensate when one is unavailable.

## Home Game 3B – Sense Backup Squad
> Jump to: [Setup](#setup-1) · [Play](#play-1) · [Scoring](#scoring-1) · [Win Condition](#win-condition-1) · [Continuity Note](#continuity-note-1)

### Learning Objective
Students will describe what happens when one sense is unavailable and others must work harder to compensate, and will recognize that senses act like teammates contributing strengths.

### Game File Name & Format
`hg-02.03-02.html` — Cause & Effect Chains — Players arrange logical sequences showing how remaining senses compensate when one sense is unavailable, demonstrating adaptive multisensory teamwork.

### Game Purpose
This game illustrates how the sensory system adapts when one "teammate" is unavailable. Players learn that senses don't just work together—they can compensate for each other, with remaining senses working harder or providing alternative information pathways when needed.

### Estimated Play Time
8–10 minutes (approximately 1–1.5 minutes per scenario, 8 scenarios total)

### Setup
Player sees a split-screen layout:

**Left side:** Shows a character with one sense depicted as "unavailable":
- Eyes closed (sight unavailable)  
- Ears covered (sound unavailable)  
- Hands behind back (touch unavailable)  

**Center:** A task card displays the challenge (e.g., *"Navigate safely across your bedroom in the dark"*)  

**Right side:** A vertical sequence builder with 5 empty slots numbered 1–5, each with a label:
1. "What sense is missing?"  
2. "What information do I NOT have?"  
3. "Which senses CAN help?"  
4. "How will they work harder?"  
5. "What's the result?"  

Below are 8–10 scrambled answer cards that player must arrange in the correct logical sequence.

Text prompt: *"One sense is unavailable. Build the cause-and-effect chain showing how the other senses work as backup!"*

A **Return to Home Games** button appears in the top-right corner, linking back to `hg-02.03.html`.

### Play
Step-by-step gameplay:

- **Scenario presented:** Character appears with one sense unavailable (e.g., eyes closed) and a task to complete (e.g., "Find your way across the bedroom").  
- **Card arrangement:** Player drags answer cards from the scrambled pile into the 5 sequence slots to build the logical cause-effect chain.  

**Example chain (eyes closed / bedroom navigation):**  
1. "Sight is missing" (drag card showing crossed-out eyes)  
2. "I can't see where furniture is" (drag card showing information gap)  
3. "Ears and Hands CAN help" (drag cards showing available senses)  
4. "Ears listen for echoes; Hands feel for walls and objects" (drag compensatory strategy cards)  
5. "I navigate safely but slowly using sound and touch" (drag result card)  

**Sequence validation:** After all 5 slots filled, player taps “Check My Chain” button.  

**Feedback:**  
- Correct sequence: Chain lights up green, connecting arrows appear between slots. Animation shows character successfully completing task using backup senses. Text: *"Perfect! Your chain shows how EARS and HANDS worked as a backup team when EYES couldn't help. The mind adapted by using alternative sensory information!"*  
- Incorrect sequence: Specific incorrect slots flash red. Text: *"Check slot 3. Did you identify which senses CAN still help? Try rearranging."*  

**Next scenario:** After correct sequence, new scenario appears with different sense unavailable (8 scenarios total).  

#### Sample Scenarios (8 total)
1. **Eyes closed, navigate bedroom**  
   - Missing: Sight  
   - Information gap: Can't see obstacles  
   - Backup senses: Ears (listen for sounds/echoes), Hands (feel walls/furniture)

  - Correct sequence on first try = 5 points  
  - Correct sequence on second try = 3 points  
  - Correct sequence on third try = 1 point  
- **Backup Hero Badge:** Complete 6 or more scenarios with correct sequence on first try = earn *“Sensory Backup Hero”* badge  
- **Total possible:** 40 points (8 scenarios × 5 points max), 1 Backup Hero Badge  

### Win Condition
Player completes the game by correctly sequencing all 8 cause-effect chains. Final screen displays:

- Total points earned  
- Number of scenarios solved on first try  
- Backup Hero Badge (if earned)  
- Summary message: *"You understand sensory teamwork! When one sense can't do its job, the other senses work harder and provide alternative information. The mind is excellent at adapting — using available senses to compensate for missing ones. This is how sensory teammates support each other!"*  
- Button options: “Play Again” or “Return to Home Games”

### Continuity Note
This game deepens Lesson 3's understanding by showing that multisensory integration includes adaptation and compensation. When senses work together, they not only combine their strengths but also back each other up when needed. This naturally bridges to Lesson 4's exploration of individual differences in sensory experiences and the accommodations that help everyone's senses work optimally.

## How Lesson 3 Fits into the Full Learning Arc

Lesson 3 represents the **integration phase** of Unit 2’s learning arc—where students move from recognizing and differentiating individual senses to understanding how they collaborate and adapt as a unified system. The two home games create direct experiences that transform abstract ideas into lived insight: sensory teamwork and compensation.

- **Lesson 1:** Introduced senses as doorways for collecting information.  
- **Lesson 2:** Showed how each sense specializes in certain information and why they can’t replace one another.  
- **Lesson 3 (this document):** Demonstrates how the senses cooperate and compensate—proving through play that multisensory input leads to stronger memory and flexible adaptation.  
- **Lesson 4:** Will explore personal differences in sensory sensitivity and how people can support their senses for optimal learning and perception.

> 🌈 **Learning Arc Summary:** Awareness → Specialization → Integration → Adaptation.  
> By experiencing sensory teamwork firsthand, children gain **self-efficacy** in managing how they perceive and respond to their environment—realizing that even when one ability is limited, their mind can adapt through collaboration among senses. This insight strengthens confidence and mental resilience built from knowledge, not instruction.
