> Jump to: [Setup](#setup) · [Play](#play) · [Scoring](#scoring) · [Win Condition](#win-condition) · [Continuity Note](#continuity-note)

### Learning Objective
Students will recognize that people experience the same sensory input differently due to variations in sensitivity and preferences, and will identify examples of sensory differences in themselves and others.

### Game File Name & Format
`hg-02.04-01.html` — Emotion Recognition / Matching (adapted for sensory responses)

### Game Purpose
Players observe how different characters react to identical sensory stimuli and match each character's response to their experience level, building empathy for sensory diversity.

### Estimated Play Time
8–10 minutes (approximately 45–60 seconds per scenario, 10 scenarios total)

### Setup
Player sees a scene with four diverse animated characters (different ages, appearances, expressions) standing in a row, each labeled with their name:

- **Maya** (appears calm and observant)  
- **Leo** (appears energetic and responsive)  
- **Zara** (appears cautious and sensitive)  
- **Kai** (appears relaxed and easygoing)

At the top, a sensory stimulus is described and illustrated (e.g., "Everyone hears the same loud music at a school dance").

Below each character are three response bubbles (empty initially):

- 😊 Comfortable/Enjoys it  
- 😐 Neutral/Okay with it  
- 😟 Uncomfortable/Overwhelmed  

After reading the scenario, all four characters show animated reactions simultaneously (facial expressions, body language, movements).

Text prompt: *"Watch how each person responds to the same sensory experience. Match each character to how they're feeling!"*

A **Return to Home Games** button appears in the top-right corner, linking back to `hg-02.04.html`.

### Play
Step-by-step gameplay:

- **Stimulus presented:** A sensory scenario appears at top with illustration (e.g., "Loud music at school dance" with speaker icon and sound waves).  
- **Characters react:** All four characters simultaneously show their unique reactions:  
  - Maya: Covers ears slightly, looks uncomfortable, steps back  
  - Leo: Dances enthusiastically, smiles widely, moves toward music  
  - Zara: Covers ears fully, looks distressed, moves to corner  
  - Kai: Nods to beat calmly, neutral expression, stays in place  
- **Observation period:** Player watches reactions for 8 seconds (can replay animation if needed).  
- **Matching task:** Player drags the appropriate response bubble to each character:  
  - Drag 😊 (comfortable) to Leo  
  - Drag 😐 (neutral) to Kai  
  - Drag 😟 (uncomfortable) to Maya and Zara  
- **Feedback:**  
  - Correct matches: Characters light up with gentle glow. Text: *"Yes! Leo LOVES loud music—his brain finds it exciting. Maya and Zara find it too intense—their ears are more sensitive. Kai doesn't mind either way. All four brains experience the same sound differently, and every response is valid!"*  
  - Incorrect match: Character bounces slightly. Text: *"Look at Zara's face and body language again. Does she look comfortable or overwhelmed?"*  
- **Educational insight:** After correct matching, a brief info panel explains WHY these differences exist: *"People's brains process sensory information with different sensitivity levels. Some notice sensory details very strongly; others barely notice them. This is normal brain variation."*  
- **Next scenario:** New sensory situation appears (10 scenarios total covering sight, sound, and touch).  

**Sample scenarios (10 total):**

- **Sound scenarios:** Loud music at dance; Quiet library (some prefer, some find too quiet); Alarm clock buzzing; Multiple people talking at once  
- **Sight scenarios:** Bright fluorescent classroom lights; Dimly lit cozy room; Lots of colorful decorations; Flashing lights at assembly  
- **Touch scenarios:** Group hug from friends; Scratchy clothing tag; Cold swimming pool; Soft fuzzy blanket  

Note: Character responses vary by individual AND by scenario. Same character might be comfortable in one situation but uncomfortable in another, showing that sensory responses depend on both the person AND the specific stimulus.

### Scoring
- **Points earned:**  
  - All 4 characters matched correctly on first try = 4 points  
  - 3 matched correctly = 2 points  
  - 2 or fewer matched correctly = 0 points (but can retry)  
- **Empathy Star:** Complete scenario with all 4 correct on first try = earn an "Empathy Star"  
- **Total possible:** 40 points (10 scenarios × 4 points max), up to 10 Empathy Stars  

### Win Condition
Player completes the game by correctly matching all character responses across 10 scenarios. Final screen displays:

- Total points earned  
- Number of Empathy Stars collected  
- Character profiles showing sensory preferences summary  
- Summary message: *"You're an Empathy Expert! You understand that everyone's brain experiences senses differently. What feels good to one person might feel overwhelming to another. These differences are normal variations in how brains process information—not problems to fix. When we recognize and respect sensory differences, we support each other better!"*  
- Button options: “Play Again” or “Return to Home Games”

### Continuity Note
This game applies Lesson 4's core principle that sensory experiences vary across individuals based on neurological differences in sensitivity and processing. By observing and matching diverse responses to identical stimuli, players build empathy and prepare for Game 4B, which focuses on identifying helpful accommodations for different sensory needs.

## Home Game 4B – Sensory Support Sprint
> Jump to: [Setup](#setup-1) · [Play](#play-1) · [Scoring](#scoring-1) · [Win Condition](#win-condition-1) · [Continuity Note](#continuity-note-1)

### Learning Objective
Students will apply the idea that people experience sensory input differently by suggesting simple tools or adjustments that help everyone's senses work well, and will demonstrate respect for sensory differences.

### Game File Name & Format
`hg-02.04-02.html` — Time Management (Casual Game)

### Game Purpose
Players race against time to provide appropriate sensory accommodations for characters with different needs, reinforcing quick, practical thinking about supporting sensory diversity.

### Estimated Play Time
7–10 minutes (approximately 2–3 minutes per round × 3 rounds, with brief transitions)

### Setup
Player sees a split-screen workspace:

**Left side:** A queue of 5 characters waiting for help, each with a speech bubble describing their sensory challenge (e.g., "The classroom lights are too bright for my eyes" or "Background noise makes it hard for me to focus").  
**Right side:** A "Support Toolbox" containing 12 accommodation cards arranged in a grid:

- Glasses / Reading glasses  
- Dimmer switch / Adjustable lighting  
- Noise-canceling headphones  
- Quiet corner space  
- Fidget toy  
- Soft, tagless clothing  
- Hearing aid  
- Weighted blanket  
- Sunglasses  
- Visual schedule  
- Textured seat cushion  
- Volume control / Adjustable sound  

At the top is a countdown timer starting at 3:00 minutes.

Text prompt: *"Quick! These students need sensory support. Drag the right tool to each person before time runs out!"*

A **Return to Home Games** button appears in the top-right corner, linking back to `hg-02.04.html`.

### Play
Step-by-step gameplay:

- **Timer starts:** 3-minute countdown begins immediately.  
- **Character needs appear:** First character in queue shows their sensory challenge (e.g., "Sam: The lights are too bright for me").  
- **Tool selection:** Player quickly scans the Support Toolbox and drags the appropriate accommodation to the character (e.g., dimmer switch or sunglasses).  
- **Feedback:**  
  - Correct tool: Character smiles, gives thumbs up. Tool card disappears from toolbox (used). Character moves out of queue. Points awarded. Text: *"Perfect! Dimmer lighting helps Sam's eyes feel comfortable. Sam can focus better now!"*  
  - Incorrect tool: Character looks confused. Tool bounces back to toolbox. Text: *"Hmm, will a fidget toy help with bright lights? What tool helps EYES?"*  
- **Next character:** Immediately after helping one character (correctly), the next person in queue moves forward with their need.  
- **Progressive difficulty:**  
  - Round 1 (first 5 characters): Simple, obvious matches (bright lights → dimmer, loud noise → headphones)  
  - Round 2 (next 5 characters): Slightly trickier (multiple tools might partially help, but one is optimal)  
  - Round 3 (final 5 characters): Some characters need TWO accommodations working together  
- **Time pressure:** Timer constantly visible, adding urgency. Bonus points for helping characters quickly.  
- **Round completion:** After helping 5 characters, timer pauses. Brief celebration, then next round begins with timer reset to 3:00 for next 5 characters.  

**Sample character needs (15 total across 3 rounds):**

- **Round 1:** Simple matches  
  - "Lights are too bright" → Dimmer switch or Sunglasses  
  - "Background noise distracts me" → Noise-canceling headphones  
  - "I need to move while I work" → Fidget toy  
  - "I can't see the board clearly" → Glasses  
  - "Scratchy clothes bother my skin" → Soft, tagless clothing  

- **Round 2:** Moderate difficulty  
  - "I have trouble hearing the teacher" → Hearing aid  
  - "The classroom feels too chaotic" → Quiet corner space  
  - "Textures under my hands help me focus" → Textured seat cushion  
  - "Sudden loud sounds startle me" → Volume control  
  - "I need to know what's happening next" → Visual schedule  

- **Round 3:** Complex needs (some require 2 tools)  
  - "I'm sensitive to light AND sound" → Dimmer switch + Headphones  
  - "I need deep pressure to feel calm" → Weighted blanket  
  - "I can't see well AND the room is too loud" → Glasses + Quiet space  
  - "Bright lights hurt but I need to see clearly" → Sunglasses + Desk lamp positioning  
  - "I need movement breaks AND a predictable routine" → Fidget toy + Visual schedule  

### Scoring
- **Points earned:**  
  - Correct tool in <10 seconds = 3 points  
  - Correct tool in 10–20 seconds = 2 points  
  - Correct tool in >20 seconds = 1 point  
  - Bonus: Both tools correct for complex needs = +5 points  
- **Speed Star:** Help 5 characters in under 2 minutes = earn a "Quick Support Star"  
- **Perfect Round:** All 5 characters helped correctly on first try = earn "Perfect Support Badge"  
- **Total possible:** 60 points (15 characters, varying point values based on speed), up to 3 Speed Stars, up to 3 Perfect Support Badges  

### Win Condition
Player completes the game by successfully providing appropriate accommodations for all 15 characters across 3 rounds before time expires. Final screen displays:

- Total points earned  
- Average response time  
- Number of Speed Stars and Perfect Support Badges collected  
- Summary message: *"You're a Sensory Support Champion! You understand that simple tools and adjustments help people's unique sensory systems work their best. These accommodations aren't 'special treatment'—they're smart science. When we quickly recognize and respect sensory needs, everyone can focus, learn, and thrive. That's what empathy in action looks like!"*  
- Button options: “Play Again” or “Return to Home Games”

### Continuity Note
This game completes Unit 2's learning arc by applying empathy for sensory differences through rapid, practical problem-solving. Players practice identifying needs and deploying accommodations under time pressure, building both understanding and quick-thinking skills. This reinforces the unit's final message: knowledge about how senses work (individually, together, and differently across people) leads to both self-efficacy and practical support for others.

## How Lesson 4 Fits into the Full Learning Arc

Lesson 4 brings **Unit 2: Exploring Our Senses** to its conclusion by transforming sensory awareness into empathy and inclusion. Earlier lessons established how senses gather and process information, how they differ in focus and interaction, and how attention shapes perception. Lesson 4 expands this understanding to the social level: recognizing that even when people share the same sensory environment, their experiences can differ in intensity, comfort, or enjoyment — all perfectly normal variations of the human mind.

Through this lens, students learn that sensory diversity is not a problem to be fixed but a reality to be respected. They begin to see that understanding others’ sensory worlds requires observation, curiosity, and adaptability — the same scientific mindset they have practiced throughout the unit. This shift from *knowing how senses work* to *appreciating how senses differ* deepens both cognitive understanding and social-emotional maturity.

> 🌈 **Learning Arc Summary:** Awareness → Understanding → Empathy → Support.  
> By the end of Lesson 4, learners see that what they know about the senses can help them care for others as well as themselves. This sense of capability — knowing how to notice, understand, and respond — is the start of genuine confidence and resilience.
