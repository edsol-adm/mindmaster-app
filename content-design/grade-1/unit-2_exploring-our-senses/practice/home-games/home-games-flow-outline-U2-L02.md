> Jump to: [Setup](#setup) · [Play](#play) · [Scoring](#scoring) · [Win Condition](#win-condition) · [Continuity Note](#continuity-note)

### Learning Objective

Students will distinguish the unique type of information each sense provides and explain why one sense cannot fully replace another using concrete examples.

### Game Purpose

This game builds quick, confident understanding that each sense has strict limitations and capabilities. By forcing rapid true/false decisions about what senses can do, players internalize that senses are specialized tools with non-overlapping functions.

### Game File Name & Format

`hg-02.02-01.html` — True/False Quick Fire

### Estimated Play Time

5–7 minutes (20 statements at approximately 15 seconds each including feedback)

### Setup

Player sees a clean, bright screen with a large statement in the center. Below the statement are two large, colorful buttons:

* LEFT button: ✅ TRUE (green)
* RIGHT button: ❌ FALSE (red)

Above the statement is a timer bar showing time remaining (starts at 10 seconds per question).

At the top are three sense icons (eyes, ears, hands) glowing to indicate the game covers all three.

Text prompt: *"Can this sense do this job? TRUE or FALSE? Choose quickly!"*

A **Return to Home Games** button appears in the top-right corner, linking back to `hg-02.02.html`.

### Play

Step-by-step gameplay:

* **Statement appears:** A clear statement displays (e.g., *"Your EARS can tell you what color something is"*).
* **Timer starts:** 10-second countdown begins (visual timer bar depletes).
* **Player decision:** Player taps TRUE or FALSE button.
* **Immediate feedback:**

  * **Correct:** Statement flashes green, checkmark appears. Brief text: *"Correct! Only your EYES can see colors. Ears detect sounds, not colors."*
  * **Incorrect:** Statement flashes red, X appears. Brief text: *"Not quite. Think: Can your ears SEE? Which sense detects colors?"*
* **Scoring display:** Points appear (+2 for quick correct answer within 5 seconds, +1 for correct answer after 5 seconds, 0 for incorrect).
* **Next statement:** New statement appears immediately (rapid-fire pace).
* **Progressive difficulty:** First 10 statements are straightforward, next 10 include trickier scenarios (e.g., *"Your EYES can tell if something is cold"* — FALSE, but players might think seeing ice means eyes detect cold).
* **Round completion:** After 20 statements, game ends.

**Sample statements (mix of TRUE and FALSE):**

TRUE statements:

* *"Your EYES can see if something is moving"*
* *"Your EARS can hear if someone is shouting or whispering"*
* *"Your HANDS can feel if water is hot or cold"*
* *"Your EYES can tell you what shape something is"*
* *"Your EARS can hear music"*
* *"Your HANDS can feel if something is smooth or bumpy"*
* *"Your EYES can see colors like red and blue"*
* *"Your EARS can tell you when someone calls your name"*
* *"Your HANDS can feel if something is soft or hard"*
* *"Your EYES can see if a light is bright or dim"*

FALSE statements:

* *"Your EARS can tell you what color something is"*
* *"Your EYES can hear sounds"*
* *"Your HANDS can see shapes"*
* *"Your EARS can feel if something is rough"*
* *"Your EYES can tell if something is hot just by looking"* (FALSE — tricky!)
* *"Your HANDS can hear voices"*
* *"Your EARS can see movement"*
* *"Your EYES can feel textures"*
* *"Your HANDS can tell what color something is by touching"*
* *"Your EARS can smell food"*

### Scoring

* **Points earned:**

  * Correct answer in ≤5 seconds = 2 points
  * Correct answer in 6–10 seconds = 1 point
  * Incorrect answer or timeout = 0 points
* **Streak bonus:** 5 correct answers in a row = earn *"Quick Thinker Gem"* (+5 bonus points)
* **Total possible:** 40 points (20 statements × 2 points max), plus bonus gems

### Win Condition

Player completes the game by answering all 20 true/false statements. Final screen displays:

* Total points earned
* Number of correct answers (X/20)
* Number of Quick Thinker Gems earned
* Accuracy percentage
* Summary message: *"You understand sense specialization! Each sense has a unique job. Your EYES can't hear, your EARS can't see, and your HANDS can't detect colors. Every sense collects different types of information — and that's exactly how they're supposed to work."*
* Button options: *"Play Again"* or *"Return to Home Games"*

### Continuity Note

This game reinforces Lesson 2's core principle that each sense is specialized and irreplaceable. The rapid-fire format builds confident, intuitive understanding of sensory boundaries, preparing players for Game 2B, which applies this knowledge to problem-solving scenarios.

## Home Game 2B – Sense Lab Experiment

> Jump to: [Setup](#setup-1) · [Play](#play-1) · [Scoring](#scoring-1) · [Win Condition](#win-condition-1) · [Continuity Note](#continuity-note-1)

### Learning Objective

Students will identify which sense(s) would be most useful in specific scenarios and describe how different senses provide different details about the same object or event.

### Game Purpose

This game applies Lesson 2's principle of sensory specialization through hands-on experimentation. By testing different sense tools for various scenarios, players develop practical reasoning about which sense provides the most useful information for each situation.

### Game File Name & Format

`hg-02.02-02.html` — Drag-and-Drop Lab

### Estimated Play Time

8–10 minutes (approximately 30–45 seconds per scenario, 12 scenarios total)

### Setup

Player sees a laboratory-style workspace with three distinct areas:

* **Left side:** A vertical stack of *Scenario Cards* (illustrated situations needing sensory information)
* **Center:** A large *Experiment Zone* (empty platform where player drags scenario card)
* **Right side:** Three *Sense Tools* represented as laboratory instruments:

  * Sight Scope (telescope icon for eyes)
  * Sound Detector (microphone icon for ears)
  * Touch Tester (hand icon for skin/hands)

Text prompt: *"Drag a scenario into the Experiment Zone, then drag the BEST sense tool to solve it. Watch what happens!"*

A **Return to Home Games** button appears in the top-right corner, linking back to `hg-02.02.html`.

### Play

Step-by-step gameplay:

* **Scenario selection:** Player drags one scenario card from the left stack into the Experiment Zone (e.g., *"Find your red backpack in a pile of bags"*).
* **Sense tool selection:** Player drags one of the three Sense Tools into the Experiment Zone next to the scenario.
* **Experiment runs:** Animation shows a character using that sense to attempt the task:

  * **Optimal sense:** Character successfully completes task quickly. Confetti appears. Text: *"Perfect! EYES are the best tool because only sight can detect colors. Experiment successful!"*
  * **Suboptimal sense:** Character partially succeeds but struggles. Text: *"EARS can hear which bag is rustling, but they can't tell you which one is RED. Try a different sense tool."*
  * **Wrong sense:** Character fails completely. Text: *"HANDS can feel the bag's texture, but they can't see colors. This sense won't solve the problem."*
* **Scoring and feedback:** Based on sense choice:

  * Best sense (optimal) = 3 stars
  * Helpful sense (suboptimal) = 1 star
  * Wrong sense = 0 stars (but player can retry)
* **Retry option:** If player didn't select optimal sense, they can drag a different sense tool to try again (can retry until optimal sense found).
* **Next scenario:** After finding optimal sense, scenario is marked complete. Player drags next scenario into Experiment Zone.
* **Progressive complexity:** Later scenarios may require recognizing that multiple senses work together (player can drag TWO sense tools for bonus points).

**Sample scenarios (12 total):**

Single optimal sense:

* *"Find your red backpack"* → EYES (sight for color)
* *"Know when someone calls your name"* → EARS (sound for voices)
* *"Tell if water is too hot before touching"* → EYES (see steam) or careful HANDS
* *"Choose the soft blanket"* → HANDS (touch for texture)
* *"See where you're walking"* → EYES (sight for navigation)
* *"Hear if a car is coming"* → EARS (sound for warning)
* *"Feel if the stove is hot"* → HANDS (touch for temperature, but carefully!)
* *"Read a book"* → EYES (sight for words)

Multiple senses useful (bonus scenarios):

* *"Play catch with a friend"* → EYES + HANDS (see ball + feel catch)
* *"Have a conversation"* → EARS + EYES (hear words + see face)
* *"Eat your favorite food"* → ALL THREE (see it, hear crunch, feel texture)
* *"Know if your friend is happy or sad"* → EYES + EARS (see face + hear tone)

### Scoring

* **Points earned:**

  * Optimal sense on first try = 3 stars
  * Optimal sense on second try = 2 stars
  * Optimal sense on third try = 1 star
  * Bonus scenarios (identifying multiple senses) = 5 stars
* **Scientist Badge:** Complete 8 scenarios with optimal sense on first try = earn *"Sense Scientist"* badge
* **Total possible:** 40 stars (12 scenarios, varying point values), up to 1 Scientist Badge

### Win Condition

Player completes the game by successfully solving all 12 scenarios using the optimal sense(s). Final screen displays:

* Total stars earned
* Scientist Badge achievement (if earned)
* Summary message: *"You're a Sense Scientist! You discovered that each sense is the perfect tool for specific jobs. EYES detect colors and shapes. EARS detect sounds. HANDS detect textures and temperatures. The mind chooses the right sense for each task — and sometimes uses multiple senses together for even better results!"*
* Button options: *"Play Again"* or *"Return to Home Games"*

### Continuity Note

This game applies Lesson 2's principle of sensory specialization through hands-on experimentation. By testing different sense tools for various scenarios, players develop practical reasoning about which sense provides the most useful information for each situation. This bridges to Lesson 3's focus on how combining multiple senses creates even more powerful understanding.

## How Lesson 2 Fits into the Full Learning Arc

Lesson 2 deepens the foundation set in Lesson 1 by exploring **sensory specialization** — the idea that each sense has a unique job and cannot be replaced by another. Through quick decision-making (Game 2A) and scientific reasoning (Game 2B), learners build an intuitive understanding of why the mind relies on different doorways for different types of information.

* **Lesson 1:** Introduced the senses as the mind's doorways and established awareness of sensory input.
* **Lesson 2 (this document):** Strengthens conceptual understanding of sensory specialization and limitations through comparison, analysis, and experimentation.
* **Lesson 3:** Extends this insight into how attention prioritizes sensory information — how the mind decides which sense to focus on.
* **Lesson 4:** Connects sensory experience to memory and imagination, showing how the mind can reuse sensory data to think about or recreate past experiences.

> 🌏 **Learning Arc Summary:** Awareness → Differentiation → Attention → Reflection.
> Lesson 2 empowers learners to reason about their sensory systems, reinforcing knowledge-based self-efficacy: *"I can figure out which sense to use for each task."* This confidence strengthens mental resilience through understanding, not rote instruction.
