## Home Game 1A – Sense Doorway Hunt
> Jump to: [Setup](#setup) · [Play](#play) · [Scoring](#scoring) · [Win Condition](#win-condition) · [Continuity Note](#continuity-note)

### Learning Objective
Students will identify the three main senses (sight, sound, touch) as doorways that bring information into the mind, and will match each sense to examples of information it provides.

### Game Purpose
This game trains players to actively notice sensory information in their environment by identifying visual, auditory, and tactile elements hidden within everyday scenes. Players learn that the world is full of sensory data constantly entering through their three "doorways."

### Game File Name & Format
`hg-02.01-01.html` — Scene Explorer (Hidden Object)

### Estimated Play Time
7–10 minutes (approximately 2–3 minutes per scene, 3 scenes total)

### Setup
Player sees a vibrant, detailed illustrated scene (e.g., a busy playground). The scene contains 15 hidden sensory elements marked with subtle glowing outlines (not immediately obvious).

At the top of the screen are three "Doorway Counters":

- **EYES Counter (blue)** — Shows 0/5 visual items found  
- **EARS Counter (green)** — Shows 0/5 sound items found  
- **HANDS Counter (orange)** — Shows 0/5 touch items found  

Text prompt: *"Tap the sensory clues hidden in this scene! Find 5 things your EYES notice, 5 your EARS hear, and 5 your HANDS feel."*

A **Return to Home Games** button appears in the top-right corner, linking back to `hg-02.01.html`.

### Play
Step-by-step gameplay:

- **Scene exploration:** Player explores the illustrated scene, looking for glowing outlines around objects.  
- **Element discovery:** When player taps a hidden element, it animates and identifies itself:  
  - **EYES elements:** Red balloon, colorful flowers, friend's smiling face, bright sun, rainbow umbrella (visual items animate with sparkle)  
  - **EARS elements:** Barking dog (sound waves appear), ringing bell, music notes from radio, friend calling name, bird chirping (audio cue plays)  
  - **HANDS elements:** Soft grass (texture pattern), warm sunshine (heat waves), cold water fountain, rough tree bark, smooth slide (tactile feedback animation)  
- **Doorway sorting:** After tapping, the element flies into the correct Doorway Counter at the top, incrementing the count (e.g., "EYES: 1/5").  
- **Feedback:** Brief text appears: *"Your EYES see the red balloon! Colors come through the sight doorway."*  
- **Progressive discovery:** Player continues tapping until all 15 elements are found (5 per sense).  
- **Level progression:** After completing one scene, a new scene appears (3 total scenes: playground, kitchen, bedroom).  

**Sample scenes and elements:**

- **Playground:**  
  Visual (balloons, flowers, faces, sun, umbrella),  
  Sound (dog barking, bell, music, calling, birds),  
  Touch (grass, sunshine warmth, water fountain, tree bark, slide)  

- **Kitchen:**  
  Visual (red apple, yellow banana, family photos, clock, window view),  
  Sound (timer beeping, water running, sizzling pan, voices talking, door closing),  
  Touch (cold fridge, warm stove, smooth counter, soft towel, bumpy sponge)  

- **Bedroom:**  
  Visual (blue walls, stuffed animals, books, stars on ceiling, lamp light),  
  Sound (music player, rain outside, clock ticking, family downstairs, rustling blankets),  
  Touch (soft pillow, fuzzy blanket, cool floor, rough carpet, smooth book cover)

### Scoring
- **Points earned:** 1 point per correct element tapped and identified.  
- **Speed bonus:** Complete a full scene (all 15 elements) in under 2 minutes = earn a "Quick Finder Star."  
- **Total possible:** 45 points (15 elements × 3 scenes), up to 3 Quick Finder Stars.  
- **Progress tracker:** Shows scene number (1/3, 2/3, 3/3) and elements remaining per sense.  

### Win Condition
Player completes the game by finding all 45 sensory elements across 3 scenes.  
Final screen displays:

- Total points earned  
- Number of Quick Finder Stars collected  
- Summary message: *"You discovered sensory doorways everywhere! Your EYES, EARS, and HANDS are always collecting information from the world around you. The mind uses all three doorways to understand what's happening."*  
- Button options: “Play Again” or “Return to Home Games”

### Continuity Note
This game establishes the foundational concept from Lesson 1: senses are doorways constantly gathering information. By actively searching for sensory elements in realistic scenes, players develop awareness that their environment is rich with data entering through sight, sound, and touch. This prepares them for Game 1B, which explores what each doorway specifically collects.

## Home Game 1B – Doorway Data Explorer
> Jump to: [Setup](#setup-1) · [Play](#play-1) · [Scoring](#scoring-1) · [Win Condition](#win-condition-1) · [Continuity Note](#continuity-note-1)

### Learning Objective
Students will explain that without senses, the mind wouldn't know what is happening in the world around us, and will describe how senses function as organized systems, each with a specific job.

### Game Purpose
This game deepens understanding of how each sensory doorway functions as an organized information-gathering system. Players explore the specific types of data each sense collects and how that data travels to the mind for processing, reinforcing that senses are not random but purposeful systems.

### Game File Name & Format
`hg-02.01-02.html` — Interactive Diagrams

### Estimated Play Time
8–10 minutes (approximately 2–3 minutes per doorway exploration, plus matching activities)

### Setup
Player sees a large, friendly illustrated diagram showing a child's silhouette in the center, with three glowing "doorways" (pathways) leading from sensory organs to a central "Mind Hub" (represented as a glowing brain):

- **EYES doorway (blue pathway from eyes to mind)**  
- **EARS doorway (green pathway from ears to mind)**  
- **HANDS doorway (orange pathway from skin/hands to mind)**  

Around the child are floating information cards showing various types of data (colors, sounds, textures) with question marks.

Text prompt: *"Tap each doorway to learn what information it brings to the mind!"*

A **Return to Home Games** button appears in the top-right corner, linking back to `hg-02.01.html`.

### Play
Step-by-step gameplay:

- **Doorway selection:** Player taps one of the three sensory doorways (eyes, ears, or hands).  
- **Information reveal:** The selected doorway glows and pulses. A detailed panel slides in showing:  
  - **Label:** "EYES DOORWAY (Sight)"  
  - **Job description:** "Collects visual information"  
  - **Data types collected:** Animated icons appear showing colors, shapes, sizes, movements, brightness, patterns  
  - **Example:** "Without your eyes, the mind wouldn't know what color things are, how big they are, or where they're located."  
  - **Flow animation:** Information cards float from the doorway icon along the pathway to the Mind Hub  
- **Interactive exploration:** Within the panel, player can tap individual data type icons to see specific examples:  
  - Tap "colors" → see red apple, blue sky, green grass with labels  
  - Tap "shapes" → see circle, square, triangle examples  
  - Tap "movements" → see animated car driving, bird flying  
- **Data matching mini-activity:** After exploring a doorway, player is shown 6 information cards and must drag the ones that belong to this doorway into a collection basket. Immediate feedback on correct/incorrect.  
- **Completion and next doorway:** After successfully matching data types, that doorway is marked complete. Player returns to main diagram and selects the next doorway.  
- **Final synthesis:** After exploring all three doorways, a final screen shows all three pathways lighting up simultaneously with data flowing to the Mind Hub. Text: *"All three doorways work together to give the mind a complete picture of the world!"*

**Data type examples by doorway:**

- **EYES (Sight):** Red color, round shape, big vs. small, fast movement, bright light, striped pattern  
- **EARS (Sound):** Loud noise, soft whisper, high pitch, low pitch, familiar voice, music rhythm  
- **HANDS (Touch):** Soft texture, rough texture, hot temperature, cold temperature, smooth surface, bumpy surface  

### Scoring
- **Points earned:**  
  - Complete exploration of one doorway = 5 points  
  - Correct data matching (6 cards per doorway) = 1 point per correct match  
  - Total per doorway = 11 points possible  
- **Explorer Badge:** Complete all three doorways = earn "Sensory System Explorer" badge  
- **Total possible:** 33 points, 1 Explorer Badge  

### Win Condition
Player completes the game by exploring all three sensory doorways and successfully matching data types to each.  
Final screen displays:

- Total points earned  
- Explorer Badge achievement  
- Summary message: *"You discovered how sensory doorways work! Each doorway has a specific job collecting certain types of information. Without these doorways, the mind would be completely in the dark about the world. The senses are the mind's organized information systems."*  
- Button options: “Play Again” or “Return to Home Games”

### Continuity Note
This game extends Lesson 1's concept that senses are organized doorways by showing the specific types of information each collects. The interactive exploration format allows players to build detailed understanding of sensory specialization, which prepares them for Lesson 2's focus on why each sense cannot be replaced by another.

## How Lesson 1 Fits into the Full Learning Arc

Lesson 1 introduces **the senses as the mind’s doorways**—the first step in helping learners recognize that every moment of awareness begins with sensory input. The two home games build this foundation by guiding children to *notice*, *classify*, and *analyze* the information entering through sight, sound, and touch.  

- **Lesson 1 (this document):** Establishes the concept of sensory doorways and trains observation skills through discovery and classification.  
- **Lesson 2:** Deepens understanding of sensory specialization and why each sense has a unique, irreplaceable role.  
- **Lesson 3:** Connects sensory input to attention, perception, and focus—how the mind chooses which doorway to prioritize.  
- **Lesson 4:** Explores how memory and imagination reuse sensory data to form mental representations.

> 🌈 **Learning Arc Summary:** Perception → Differentiation → Focus → Integration.  
> This arc strengthens the foundation for self-efficacy: children begin to understand that awareness and focus start with mastering their senses—transforming knowledge of the world into confidence in their own ability to notice, learn, and adapt.
