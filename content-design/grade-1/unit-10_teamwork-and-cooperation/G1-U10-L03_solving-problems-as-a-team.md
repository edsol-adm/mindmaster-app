# Lesson 3: Solving Problems as a Team

---

## Lesson Objective
Students will understand that disagreements and challenges are normal in teamwork, and will apply cooperative problem-solving strategies (listening, sharing feelings, finding compromises, agreeing on plans) to move through conflict productively.

---

## Warm-Up (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *"Two Ideas" Scenario*

Present a quick scenario:  
> “Two kids want to be the leader of the building project. What happens if they argue and don’t listen? What happens if they listen and find a solution together?”

Act out both versions quickly (30 seconds each). Exaggerate the “arguing without listening” version to make it clear things fall apart. Then show the “listening and solving together” version where they compromise (e.g., “You lead the first part, then I’ll lead the second part.”)

Ask:  
> “Which team kept working? Which one was stronger?”

Lead-in:  
> “Today we’re learning that problems in teamwork are normal—and teams that solve them together become even stronger.”

## Explore + Practice (30 minutes)

### Explore A: Problems Are Normal (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *Video + Discussion (Media)*  

Show: “What to Do When You Disagree” by Story Time with Ms. Bookworm (or similar, ~2 min)  
**Link:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sB7QBGHNsjk  

**Alternative:** “How to Solve Conflicts” by Kids Learning Videos  
**Link:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ_dU0I6WpE  

> **Note:** This video is *indicative only*. In the full MindMaster version, a copyright-free or custom video will be produced to illustrate the same conflict-resolution concept.

After the video, ask:  
> “What did the characters do when they disagreed? Did they listen to each other? What happened?”

**Key Point:**  
> “Disagreements happen. The question is: Do we listen and solve it together, or do we just argue?”

### Practice A: Psychology Experiment – “Listening vs. Not Listening” (via MindMaster) (8 minutes)

**Activity:** *Interactive Experiment (MindMaster App with Clicker Technology)*  

**Experiment Format:** Role-Play Scenarios with Prediction + Outcome

**Setup:** Present pairs of scenarios on the TV. For each pair, students predict the outcome (using clickers), then see what actually happened.

**Scenario Pairs:**

**Pair 1 – Prediction Phase:**  
Screen shows:  
> “Two friends want different things: one wants to build tall, one wants to build wide. What will happen?”  
Clicker options:  
1. They’ll listen and find a way  
2. They’ll argue and stop building  
3. One will give up  

Students click their prediction.

**Pair 1 – Outcome Phase:**  
Show what actually happened:  
> “They listened. One said, ‘Let’s build a tower that’s tall AND wide.’ They solved it together!”  
Discussion:  
> “That’s listening. That’s problem-solving.”

**Pair 2 – Prediction Phase:**  
Screen shows:  
> “Two friends both want to use the blue blocks. What will happen?”  
Clicker options:  
1. They’ll share the blocks  
2. They’ll fight and no one gets blocks  
3. One will break something  

**Pair 2 – Outcome Phase:**  
Show:  
> “They compromised. They said, ‘You use blue blocks first for 3 minutes, then I use them.’ They took turns!”  
Discussion:  
> “That’s compromising. That’s a solution.”

**Scoring:** Not scored for right/wrong, but for engagement.  
The goal is to see that listening and compromising lead to solutions.

**Connection to Lesson:**  
This experiment shows students that cooperation during conflict produces real outcomes—teams that solve problems together keep working.

**Timing in Lesson:** After Explore A, so students have seen conflict and solutions modeled.

### Practice B: MindMaster Game – “Conflict Scenarios: What Should We Do?” (10 minutes)

**Activity:** *Game (MindMaster App with Clicker Technology)*  

**Game Format:** Multiple-Choice Decision-Making with Scenario Consequences  

**Game Flow:**
- **Setup:** Present conflict scenarios on the TV. For each scenario, students see 3–4 possible responses. They click to choose the best team response. After they choose, the screen shows the consequence of that choice (does it solve the problem or make it worse?).

**Scenario 1 – The Red Blocks:**  
Setup:  
> “Your team is building a house. Two kids want red blocks for the roof. One wants them for the walls. What should you do?”  
Options:  
- Argue until someone gives in  
- Listen to all ideas, then compromise (some blocks for roof, some for walls, or take turns)  
- One person takes all the blocks and doesn’t share  

**Consequence:**  
- If 1: Screen shows frustrated kids, tower incomplete. “Arguing didn’t solve it.”  
- If 2: Screen shows happy kids building together. “Compromise worked! Problem solved.”  
- If 3: Screen shows upset kids, one person alone. “Not fair. Team broke apart.”  
**Correct answer:** 2

**Scenario 2 – The Relay Race:**  
Setup:  
> “Your team is racing. One person says go fast. Another says go carefully. You can’t do both. What now?”  
Options:  
- Go so fast you drop the baton  
- Go so slow you lose the race  
- Listen to both ideas: go fast AND carefully (focus on speed with good handoffs)  
**Consequence:**  
If 1 or 2: “One idea won, but the team wasn’t happy.”  
If 3: “Both people felt heard. Team kept working together.”  
**Correct answer:** 3

**Scenario 3 – The Poster Problem:**  
Setup:  
> “Your team is making a poster. Three kids have different ideas. One wants a cat, one wants a dog, one wants a star. Time for only one picture. What do you do?”  
Options:  
- Draw what the loudest kid wants  
- Listen to all ideas, then vote or pick one that everyone can live with  
- Erase everyone’s ideas and do something completely different  
**Consequence:**  
If 1: “One kid happy. Others left out.”  
If 2: “Everyone listened. Everyone helped. Poster complete.”  
If 3: “Confused team. No one’s idea mattered.”  
**Correct answer:** 2

**Scoring:** 1 point per correct choice. Group total displayed after each scenario.  
**Win Condition:** Celebrate when the class reaches 2+ correct answers. Announce:  
> “You know how to solve team problems by listening and compromising!”

**Connection to Lesson:**  
This game shows students that listening and compromise are not just nice skills—they actually solve problems and keep teams strong.

**Timing in Lesson:** Play after Explore A so students have seen conflict modeled in the video.

### Practice C: MindMaster Quiz – “What’s the Smart Move?” (7 minutes)

**Quiz Format:** Multiple-Choice Scenarios with Best-Choice Responses  

**Setup:** 5 quick scenarios, each with 3–4 options. Students click the clicker button for the best way to solve the problem.

**Questions:**
1. “Your teammate wants a different role than you. What should you do?”  
   - Argue until they give in  
   - Listen to why they want it, then decide together

## Reflection (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *Pair-Share Reflection (Peer Sharing)*  

**Prompt:**  
> “Think about a time you solved a problem with a friend or family member. How did you listen to each other? Did you find a compromise? Turn to a partner and share.”

Listen for evidence that students recognize listening, compromising, and cooperation as problem-solving tools. Affirm:  
> “That’s exactly right—you used teamwork skills to solve the problem.”

## Home Prep (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *Problem-Solving Hunt (Verbal + Optional Printable)*  

> “This week, notice when grown-ups or older kids solve a problem by listening and compromising. Maybe someone in your family disagrees about something, and they listen and find a solution together. Can you spot that? Tomorrow, tell us about it.”

**Optional printable checklist:**  
- Did you see someone listen to another person’s idea? ☐  
- Say sorry? ☐  
- Find a compromise? ☐  
- Solve a problem together? ☐

## Connection to Unit Arc
Lesson 2 → Lesson 3: Lesson 2 taught students the skills of teamwork (listening, roles). Lesson 3 now shows that those same skills are the tools for solving problems when things get hard.  
Students learn that challenges don’t break teams—they’re opportunities to practice cooperation even deeper.  
Lesson 3 → Lesson 4: Now that students have experienced teamwork (what it is), the skills that make it work, and how to solve problems together, Lesson 4 will celebrate what they’ve built. They’ll recognize that shared achievement is what binds teams together and makes future cooperation rewarding.
