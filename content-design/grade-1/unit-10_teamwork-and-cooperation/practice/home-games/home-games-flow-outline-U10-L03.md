## HOME GAME 3A: Conflict Navigator

### Learning Objective

Students will apply team problem-solving strategies (listening to all ideas, sharing feelings respectfully, finding compromises, agreeing on plans) and will distinguish between unproductive conflict patterns and productive solution-finding.

### Game File Name

hg-10.03-01.html

### Game Format

**Interactive Fiction (Adventure Game Format)**

Players navigate a branching story where their choices about conflict resolution lead to different outcomes. This format emphasizes decision-making, consequence awareness, and the application of problem-solving strategies.

### Purpose

Students practice applying conflict resolution strategies in realistic scenarios. They discover through experience that choosing to listen, compromise, and find solutions together leads to positive outcomes, while arguing without listening creates breakdown.

### Estimated Play Time

8–12 minutes (depending on path taken and replays)

### Continuity Note

This game applies Lesson 3's teaching about conflict resolution strategies through immersive decision-making. It shows that problems are normal and that productive strategies (listening, compromising, finding solutions) build trust. Game 3B will focus on recognizing conflict patterns. Lesson 4's games will celebrate achievements and collective success.

## HOME GAME 3B: Pattern Detective

### Learning Objective

Students will distinguish between unproductive conflict patterns (arguing without listening) and productive ones (cooperative solution-finding), and will recognize that solving problems together builds team trust and resilience.

### Game File Name

hg-10.03-02.html

### Game Format

**Observation Challenge (Science App Format)**

Players watch team conflict scenarios and identify whether the pattern is productive or unproductive. This format builds pattern recognition and analytical observation skills.

### Purpose

Students develop the ability to recognize conflict patterns as they unfold and distinguish between destructive and constructive team behaviors. They learn to identify early warning signs of team breakdown versus signs of healthy problem-solving.

### Estimated Play Time

10–12 minutes

### Win Condition

Player completes all 8 scenarios and receives their detective report. Win message: "Case closed! You can spot the difference between productive and unproductive conflict patterns. That's an important skill for strong teams!"

--- 

### Continuity Note

This game reinforces Lesson 3's teaching by building pattern recognition skills. Students learn to identify conflict patterns in action, which prepares them to intervene productively in real-life team situations. Lesson 4's games will shift focus to celebrating team achievements after problems are solved.

---

## How Lesson 3 Fits into the Full Learning Arc

Lesson 3 moves the unit from understanding _how_ teams work (roles and listening) into understanding _what to do when teamwork breaks down_. Through Home Game 3A (Conflict Navigator), students actively make choices inside branching conflict scenarios, practising strategies such as listening, sharing feelings respectfully, finding compromises, and repairing relationships. Home Game 3B (Pattern Detective) then helps them step back and recognise the underlying patterns behind conflict—spotting the difference between unproductive behaviours (arguing without listening, blaming, giving up) and productive ones (cooperating, compromising, building solutions together). Together, these games transform “conflict” from something scary or personal into something predictable, observable, and solvable.

- **Lesson 1:** Introduced the foundation of teamwork—teams achieve more than individuals, and cooperation is distinct from simply being together. Students experienced how shared goals transform what a group can accomplish.
- **Lesson 2:** Explained the internal mechanics of teamwork. Students learned that roles (Leader, Organizer, Creator, Supporter) and listening skills allow teams to coordinate smoothly. They practised adjusting “listening level” and saw directly how it affects team outcomes.
- **Lesson 3 (this document):** Extends this understanding into problem-solving. Students apply strategies that repair breakdowns—listening to all ideas, sharing feelings respectfully, compromising, and making fair decisions. They also learn to identify conflict patterns, giving them the analytical tools to predict and prevent team failure.
- **Lesson 4:** Completes the unit by shifting focus from conflict to cohesion. Students learn to notice contributions, celebrate achievements, and reinforce team trust—cementing the idea that strong teams recognise and value everyone’s role in the final success.

🔧 **Learning Arc Summary:** Lesson 1 defines teamwork; Lesson 2 explains how it works; Lesson 3 teaches how to fix it when things go wrong; Lesson 4 shows how to strengthen it through shared recognition.  
By the end of Unit 10, students see that problems are normal in teamwork—and that they have the skills and strategies to turn conflicts into cooperation, preventing breakdown and building stronger, more resilient teams.
