### Continuity Note

This game reinforces Lesson 2's concept that different roles are equally valuable and necessary. It prepares students for Game 2B, which will focus on listening as the skill that allows roles to coordinate. Lesson 3's games will show what happens when roles don't coordinate (conflict).

---

## HOME GAME 2B: Listen & Build

### Learning Objective

Students will demonstrate listening carefully to others' ideas and taking turns during cooperative activity, and will compare how teamwork breaks down when people don't listen versus how smoothly it works with fair participation.

### Game File Name

hg-10.02-02.html

### Game Format

**Simulation / Sandbox (Science App Format)**

Players manipulate the "listening level" variable in team scenarios and observe how it affects team outcomes. This simulation format reinforces cause-effect reasoning and scientific observation.

### Purpose

Students experiment with different levels of listening in team scenarios to discover that listening directly affects team success. They observe that teams function smoothly when members listen, and break down when they don't.

### Estimated Play Time

9–10 minutes

### Setup

**Opening Screen:**

- Title: "Listen & Build"
- Subtitle: "How does listening change teamwork?"
- Visual: Laboratory-style interface with control panel and observation window
- Start button: "Start Experiment"

**Instructions:**

- "You're going to run experiments! You'll control how much a team listens to each other. Then watch what happens!"
- Visual: Slider control labeled "Listening Level" with emoji faces from 😤 (not listening) to 😊 (listening well)

### Play

**3 Team Scenarios (Experimental Format):**

Each scenario allows the player to set the listening level, observe the outcome, then adjust and try again.

**Scenario 1: Building a Block Castle**

- **Setup:** Four cartoon avatars appear in the observation window, ready to build
- **Control Panel:**
    - Listening slider (3 levels: Low / Medium / High)
    - "Run Experiment" button
- **Experiment A (Player sets to LOW listening):**
    - Animation plays:
        - Avatar 1: "Let's build wide!"
        - Avatar 2: "No! Tall is better!" (not listening to Avatar 1)
        - Avatar 3: "I want red blocks!" (ignoring others)
        - Avatar 4: "Wait, what are we doing?" (confused)
    - Outcome: Castle collapses. Team members look frustrated.
    - Data recorded: "Low listening = Castle fell apart. Team frustrated."
- **Experiment B (Player adjusts to HIGH listening):**
    - Animation plays:
    - Avatar 1: "Let's build wide!"
        - Avatar 2: "I hear you. What if we build wide AND add a tall tower?"
        - Avatar 3: "Good idea! I'll use red blocks for the tower."
        - Avatar 4: "I'll help with the base!"
    - Outcome: Beautiful castle appears. Team members high-five.
    - Data recorded: "High listening = Castle successful! Team happy."
- **Reflection prompt:** "What did you notice? How did listening change what happened?"
- Player clicks observations (multiple choice):
    - "When listening was low, people argued"
    - "When listening was high, people worked together"
    - "Listening helped the team succeed"
    - All correct; affirming feedback given

**Scenario 2: Making a Group Decision (What Game to Play)**

- **Setup:** Three avatars need to choose between three games
- **Control Panel:** Listening slider + "Run Experiment"
- **Experiment A (Player sets to LOW):**
    - Avatar 1: "Tag!"
    - Avatar 2: "No, hide and seek!"
    - Avatar 3: "Soccer!" (no one listening)
    - Outcome: No decision made. Everyone walks away separately. Timer runs out.
    - Data: "Low listening = No decision. Team split up."
- **Experiment B (Player sets to HIGH):**
    - Avatar 1: "I like tag!"
    - Avatar 2: "I hear you. I like hide and seek."
    - Avatar 3: "I like soccer. What if we vote?"
    - All avatars: "Good idea!"
    - Outcome: Vote happens, everyone agrees to play the winner (hide and seek). Team plays together happily.
    - Data: "High listening = Decision made. Team stayed together."

**Scenario 3: Solving a Puzzle Together**

- **Setup:** Four avatars have puzzle pieces to assemble
- **Control Panel:** Listening slider
- **Experiment A (Player sets to MEDIUM - introduces partial listening):**
    - Avatar 1: "This piece goes here"
    - Avatar 2: "Okay!" (places piece)
    - Avatar 3: "Wait, I have a better idea—" (interrupted)
    - Avatar 4: "Just do it my way!" (not listening fully)
    - Outcome: Puzzle completed, but took longer. One avatar looks left out.
    - Data: "Medium listening = Puzzle done, but not everyone felt included."
- **Experiment B (Player sets to HIGH):**
    - Avatar 1: "This piece goes here"
    - Avatar 2: "Good idea!"
    - Avatar 3: "Wait, I see a faster way—what if we sort by color first?"
    - Avatar 4: "Great thinking! Let's try that!"
    - Outcome: Puzzle completed quickly. All avatars celebrate together.
    - Data: "High listening = Puzzle done fast! Everyone felt important."

## How Lesson 2 Fits into the Full Learning Arc

Lesson 2 takes the foundation from Lesson 1—"teams can do more than one person"—and moves inside the machinery of teamwork. Through Home Game 2A (Role Factory), students see that cooperation is not just many hands working at once, but different roles working in a clear sequence: leading, organizing, creating, and supporting. Through Home Game 2B (Listen & Build), they test how listening acts as the "glue" that allows these roles to coordinate. Together, the two games turn teamwork from a vague idea into something concrete, observable, and controllable: roles can be shared, and listening levels can be adjusted like a slider.

* **Lesson 1:** Establishes that teamwork means combining efforts toward a shared goal, not just sitting near others. Students experience how adding teammates changes what is possible and learn to spot the difference between proximity and true cooperation.
* **Lesson 2 (this document):** Zooms in on *how* teams function on the inside. Home Game 2A shows that strong teams distribute responsibility across different roles and that each role contributes to success. Home Game 2B then demonstrates that listening and turn-taking determine whether those roles fit together smoothly or fall apart. Students begin to understand that they can shape teamwork by both *how they listen* and *which role they play*.
* **Lesson 3:** Builds on this by exploring what happens when teamwork goes wrong—when roles clash, listening breaks down, or more than one person tries to take the same role. Students practise cooperative problem-solving and simple conflict-resolution strategies that repair team functioning rather than blame individuals.
* **Lesson 4:** Brings the arc to a close by focusing on shared recognition and celebration. Students learn to notice what the team achieved and to appreciate different contributions—leaders, organisers, creators, and supporters—cementing the idea that success belongs to the group, not just the most visible role.

> 🤝 **Learning Arc Summary:** Lesson 1 defines what teamwork is; Lesson 2 explains how it works from the inside (roles + listening); Lesson 3 tackles what to do when it breaks; Lesson 4 celebrates what teams can achieve together.
> By the end of Unit 10, students see themselves not only as helpers inside a team, but as *active shapers* of how their teams function. They understand that listening carefully and sharing roles fairly are skills they can use to make cooperation smoother in families, classrooms, and communities.
