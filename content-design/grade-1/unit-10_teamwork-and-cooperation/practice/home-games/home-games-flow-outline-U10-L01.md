> Jump to: [Setup](#setup) · [Play](#play) · [Scoring](#scoring) · [Win Condition](#win-condition) · [Continuity Note](#continuity-note)

### Learning Objective

Students will define teamwork as combining efforts with others to achieve what would be difficult or impossible alone, and will identify how cooperation changes what's possible.

### Game File Name & Format

`hg-10.01-01.html` — Build & Test (Science App Format)

This format allows children to construct different team configurations and test cooperation outcomes through experimentation, reinforcing the scientific observation that teamwork produces measurably different results than individual effort.

### Game Purpose

Students experiment with building teams of different sizes and configurations to discover that combining efforts (teamwork) produces results that individual work cannot achieve as easily. This reinforces the lesson's core concept that cooperation changes what's possible.

### Estimated Play Time

6–8 minutes

### Setup

**Opening Screen:**

* Title: "Team Builder Lab"
* Subtitle: "Can one person do it alone? Or do we need a team?"
* Visual: A construction workspace with building materials (blocks, tools, blueprint)
* Start button: "Begin Experiment"

**Instructions Screen:**

* "You're going to build three different towers. First, you'll try with one builder. Then with two builders. Then with a team of four builders. Let's see what happens!"
* Visual: Three cartoon avatars (diverse, friendly, simple design) standing ready

---

### Play

**Round 1: One Builder**

* Screen shows one cartoon avatar (child character) with 10 blocks
* Timer: 60 seconds
* Player taps blocks to add them to the tower (simple tap-to-stack mechanic)
* Challenge: "Build the tallest tower you can with one builder in 60 seconds"
* During play: Avatar says things like "This is hard by myself!" "I wish I had help!"
* Result recorded: Tower height = X blocks

**Round 2: Two Builders**

* Screen shows two avatars sharing 15 blocks
* Timer: 60 seconds
* Player taps blocks; this time blocks stack faster (visual shows two avatars working—one holds, one places)
* Challenge: "Now try with two builders working together!"
* During play: Avatars say "You hold this, I'll add that!" "Teamwork!"
* Result recorded: Tower height = Y blocks (noticeably taller)

**Round 3: Four Builders (Full Team)**

* Screen shows four avatars with 20 blocks
* Timer: 60 seconds
* Blocks stack even faster; avatars coordinate visibly (one passes blocks, one organizes, two build)
* Challenge: "Now with a whole team of four!"
* During play: Avatars say "Everyone has a job!" "We're doing this together!"
* Result recorded: Tower height = Z blocks (tallest)

**Results Lab Screen:**

* Bar graph appears comparing all three towers side-by-side
* Labels: "1 Builder" | "2 Builders" | "4 Builders (Team)"
* Text: "You discovered: Teams can build bigger and faster than one person alone!"
* Scientific observation prompt: "Why do you think the team tower was tallest?"
* Multiple choice responses (optional interaction):

  * "More hands to help"
  * "People can share the work"
  * "Everyone can do a different job"
* All lead to affirming text: "Yes! That's how teamwork changes what's possible."

## How Lesson 1 Fits into the Full Learning Arc

Lesson 1 opens Unit 10 by giving students concrete, gamified experiences of what **teamwork** actually is: combining efforts toward a shared goal, rather than simply being near other people. Through Home Game 1A (Team Builder Lab), they *feel* the difference that added teammates make to what is possible. Through Home Game 1B (Goal Matcher), they *see* and classify the difference between true cooperation and mere proximity. This establishes the conceptual foundation for the whole unit: teams are defined by shared goals, coordinated action, and mutual contribution.

* **Lesson 1 (this document):** Establishes teamwork as *combined effort toward a shared goal* and helps students differentiate between working near others and genuinely cooperating. Students begin to see themselves as capable contributors whose participation changes what a group can achieve.
* **Lesson 2:** Builds on this foundation by zooming in on the *skills* that make teamwork function—listening, turn-taking, and sharing roles. Students experience how distributing responsibilities and honouring different roles (leading, organizing, creating, supporting) makes groups more effective and inclusive.
* **Lesson 3:** Introduces the reality that teamwork includes challenges—disagreements, overlapping ideas, and mistakes—and reframes these as chances for *collective problem-solving*. Students practise resolving conflicts through listening, compromise, and shared decision-making, strengthening trust inside the team.
* **Lesson 4:** Rounds out the arc by teaching students to *notice and celebrate* what teams achieve together. The focus shifts from individual credit ("I did it") to collective recognition ("we did it"), reinforcing belonging, shared pride, and motivation to keep cooperating in future challenges.

> 🤝 **Learning Arc Summary:** From understanding what teamwork is → to practising the skills that make it work → to solving problems together → to celebrating shared achievements.
> By the end of Unit 10, students recognise that they are not only individual problem-solvers but also valuable team members. They see that cooperation—combining thinking, feelings, and actions with others—is a powerful way to reach goals that would be harder or impossible alone.
