## HOME GAME 4A: Team Trophy Builder

### Learning Objective

Students will explain that celebrating collective achievements strengthens team spirit and belonging, and will distinguish between celebrating "winning" versus celebrating teamwork, effort, and growth.

### Game File Name

hg-10.04-01.html

### Game Format

**Drag-and-Drop Lab (Science App Format)**

Players combine different celebration elements to create team trophies, discovering which types of recognition strengthen team bonds. This format teaches cause-effect relationships in a hands-on, experimental way.

### Purpose

Students experiment with different types of celebration and recognition to discover that collective celebration (focusing on teamwork and shared effort) builds stronger team connections than individual recognition (focusing on winning or being best).

### Estimated Play Time

8–10 minutes

## Continuity Note

This capstone game brings together all of Unit 10's learning:

- **Lesson 1:** Teamwork as combined effort
- **Lesson 2:** Roles and listening
- **Lesson 3:** Solving problems together
- **Lesson 4:** Celebrating collective achievement

It allows students to reflect on the full teamwork journey and internalize that cooperation is inherently rewarding. This prepares students to approach future teamwork with confidence and positive anticipation.

---

## How Lesson 4 Fits into the Full Learning Arc

Lesson 4 completes the teamwork arc by shifting the focus from problem-solving to appreciation and collective pride. Through Home Game 4A (Team Trophy Builder), students experiment with how different types of celebration—individual recognition, winning-based praise, or collective appreciation—affect team connection. Through Home Game 4B (Our Team Story), they build a personal celebration narrative that highlights each teammate’s contributions and the journey they took together. These experiences show that strong teams do not only _work_ together; they also _recognise_ each other, reinforcing a sense of belonging that motivates future cooperation.

- **Lesson 1:** Introduced the core idea that teams achieve more than individuals and that teamwork is defined by shared effort toward a common goal. Students distinguished real cooperation from merely being side-by-side.
- **Lesson 2:** Explained the internal mechanisms that make teamwork function—role distribution and listening. Students discovered how coordinating roles and attending to others leads to smooth collaboration.
- **Lesson 3:** Showed how teams repair breakdowns. Students practised solving problems together, using strategies like listening, compromise, and fair decision-making, and learned to recognise productive versus unproductive conflict patterns.
- **Lesson 4 (this document):** Brings closure to the unit by emphasising shared recognition. Students discover that celebrating everyone’s contribution reinforces motivation, trust, and team identity—making teamwork something they want to join again in the future.

🌟 **Learning Arc Summary:** Lesson 1 defines teamwork; Lesson 2 shows how it works; Lesson 3 shows how to fix it; Lesson 4 shows how to strengthen it through shared celebration.  
By the end of Unit 10, students understand teamwork not only as coordinated effort but as a relationship built on listening, solving problems together, and appreciating each person's contribution—laying the foundation for resilient, future-oriented cooperation.
