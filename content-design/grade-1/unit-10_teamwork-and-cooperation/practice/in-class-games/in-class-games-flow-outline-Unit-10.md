## In-Class-Game 10A – The Tower Builders

**Lesson 1: Working Together Toward a Goal**

#### **Lesson Link & Learning Objective**

Students will understand that teamwork means combining efforts with others to achieve shared goals that would be difficult or impossible alone, and will recognize themselves as valuable team members who contribute to group success.

**Game File Name: icg-10.01-game01.html**

**Game Title: The Tower Builders**

**Game Format**: Virtual Experiment with Observation Challenge + Cause & Effect Prediction

This format combines:

• Interactive simulation where students observe two parallel building scenarios

• Prediction mechanics (hypothesis before observation)

• Cause-and-effect reasoning (explaining outcomes based on teamwork principles)

**Justification**: This format mirrors the psychology-as-science framework by having students form hypotheses, observe outcomes, and draw conclusions about teamwork's effects-directly reinforcing the lesson's experiential learning about cooperation versus working alone.

**Purpose**: Students discover through observation and prediction that teamwork produces different (and often better) outcomes than working alone. The game reinforces the scientific principle that combining efforts, ideas, and skills leads to measurable changes in what groups can accomplish.

**Placement in Lesson Arc**: After PRACTICE A (Build It Alone vs. Build It Together physical experiment) (18 minutes into the 30-minute Explore + Practice section)

**Pedagogical Justification**: The game is strategically placed immediately after students have had concrete, kinesthetic experience building towers physically. This sequencing follows the constructivist principle of moving from concrete to abstract: Experiential Foundation First> Extension Through Observation > Cognitive Bridging: By playing the game after hands-on experience, students have referents for what they're seeing on screen. > Pattern Recognition: The game allows students to see the principle (teamwork produces different outcomes than individual work) across multiple contexts, generalizing beyond their single physical experiment.

**Setup**

Opening Screen:

• Title: "Tower Builders: Alone vs. Together"

• Background: Split-screen view showing two identical construction sites (left and right), each with cartoon builder characters and building materials

• Visual style: Bright, clean cartoon aesthetic with simple block-building materials

• Text: "Let's discover what happens when builders work alone versus when they work together!"

• Button: "Start Experiment" (any clicker button to begin)

Correct Answer: Button 2

Feedback: "Your Action Player coordinates-you talk, help, and share jobs with teammates!"

**Part D: "How do these three mind parts create LOOPS during teamwork?"**

• Click Button 1: "Your Action Player helps others (doing) → Your Messenger feels proud (feeling) → Your Idea Factory thinks 'I'm good at teamwork' (thinking) → You want to help more (doing again)!"

• Click Button 2: "Only your Idea Factory works during teamwork"

• Click Button 3: "The three parts don't connect during teamwork"

Correct Answer: Button 1

Feedback: "You discovered the teamwork loop! When you DO helpful actions, your feelings change, which changes your thinking, which makes you DO more helpful actions. That's how the three mind parts work together in loops-and when YOUR loops connect with TEAMMATES' loops, that's teamwork!"

**ROUND 4: Final Distinction - Teamwork vs. Proximity**

**Screen Display:**

• Title: "Teamwork or Just Near Each Other?"

• Text: "Let's test if you can spot the difference!"

• 6 scenarios shown one at a time

**Scenario Format: Each scenario shows a split-screen image:**

## In-Class-Game 10B – Build the Space Station

## Lesson 2: Listening and Sharing Roles

#### **Lesson Link & Learning Objective**

Learning Objective: Students will understand that strong teams distribute responsibility so everyone contributes, and will demonstrate listening, turn-taking, and role-sharing as the skills that make teamwork possible.

**Game File Name: icg-10.02-game01.html**

**Game Title: Build the Space Station!**

**Game Format**: Role-Based Cooperative Simulation with Sequential Task Management

This format combines:

• Role assignment and rotation mechanics (students experience all four roles)

• Sequential decision-making where each role's choice affects the team outcome

• Observation of what happens when roles are performed well vs. poorly

• Cause-and-effect reasoning linking role performance to team success

**Justification**: This format directly mirrors the lesson's focus on distributed responsibility and different valuable roles. By playing through all four roles (Leader, Organizer, Creator, Supporter) and seeing how each role's actions impact the team, students discover through experience-not instruction-that every role is necessary and that listening/coordination between roles is what makes teamwork function.

**Purpose**: Students discover that teamwork requires different roles working together, and that each role-leading, organizing, creating, supporting-is equally valuable and necessary. The game demonstrates how poor listening or role performance breaks down team functioning, while good role execution strengthens it.

**Placement in Lesson Arc**: After PRACTICE B (In-Class Experiment - "What Happens When We Don't Listen?") (22 minutes into Explore + Practice section)

**Pedagogical Justification**: The game's placement after the listening experiment creates a powerful pedagogical progression. Problem Awareness First: Students first experience the breakdown that occurs when listening is absent (Practice B experiment). They viscerally feel the frustration and see the weak tower that results from not listening. > The game then provides the solution framework by introducing the four roles (Leader, Organizer, Creator, Supporter) and demonstrating how these roles, combined with listening, create functional teams. By experiencing the problem first, students are primed to understand WHY the role structure and listening skills matter. The game isn't teaching abstract concepts-it's providing tools to solve a problem they just encountered.

Motivation Through Relevance: Having just struggled without listening, students are genuinely curious about what makes teamwork work, making them receptive to the game's lessons about coordination.

**Setup**

**Opening Screen:**

• Title: "Mission Control: Build the Space Station"

• Background: Space mission control room with large screen showing an incomplete space station floating in orbit

• Visual style: Bright, clean cartoon aesthetic with space theme (stars, planets, mission control panels)

• Text: "Your team has a mission: Build a space station in orbit! Every team member has an important job. Let's discover what happens when everyone does their role well-and what happens when they don't."

• Button: "Start Mission" (any clicker button to begin)

Character Avatars (same as Lesson 1):

• Alex (yellow uniform with leadership badge)

• Jordan (blue uniform with organizing clipboard)

• Sam (red uniform with creative tools)

• Taylor (green uniform with supportive gear)

• Same avatars used from Lesson 1 to emphasize continuity in teamwork concepts

Mission Setup Display:

• Shows space station blueprint with 4 modules to build

• Each module requires all 4 roles working together

• Mission timer: Complete 4 modules in 4 rounds

**Play**

**INTRODUCTION: Meet the Roles (1 minute)**

Screen Display:

• Shows all 4 characters at mission control stations

• Text: "Every space station team needs 4 roles:"

Role Introductions (shown sequentially, 15 seconds each):

1\. Alex - The Leader

◦ Speech bubble: "I decide what we build and give the team direction!"

◦ Visual: Alex pointing at blueprint, giving thumbs up

◦ Text: "The Leader makes decisions and guides the team's plan."

2\. Jordan - The Organizer

◦ Speech bubble: "I make sure we have all the parts and tools ready!"

◦ Visual: Jordan checking off items on clipboard, organizing materials

◦ Text: "The Organizer prepares materials and keeps things in order."

3\. Sam - The Creator

◦ Speech bubble: "I think of new ideas and design solutions!"

◦ Visual: Sam sketching, having lightbulb moment

◦ Text: "The Creator generates ideas and designs what to build."

4\. Taylor - The Supporter

◦ Speech bubble: "I help others and encourage the team!"

◦ Visual: Taylor helping another character, giving high-five

◦ Text: "The Supporter assists teammates and keeps spirits high."

**Transition Screen:**

• Text: "Now let's see what happens when these roles work together-and what happens when they don't! YOU will observe each role and decide if they're doing their job well."

**ROUND 1: Building Module 1 - Observing Good vs. Poor Role Performance**

Setup Phase:

• Screen shows: "Module 1: Solar Panel Array"

• Text: "Watch how the team works. Then you'll identify what went right or wrong."

• Blueprint of solar panel array displayed

**Animation Sequence A: Poor Performance (20 seconds)**

Scene shows team attempting to build:

• Alex (Leader): Sits quietly, doesn't give any direction, looks confused

◦ Thought bubble: "Um... I don't know what to do"

• Jordan (Organizer): Didn't prepare materials, scrambling to find parts

◦ Speech bubble: "Wait! I forgot to get the solar panels!"

• Sam (Creator): Has an idea but nobody listens

◦ Speech bubble: "What if we-" (interrupted, looks frustrated)

• Taylor (Supporter): Just watching, not helping anyone

◦ Thought bubble: "I guess I'll just wait..."

Result: Module 1 incomplete, team looks frustrated, timer runs out

Student Observation Question: "What went wrong? Why didn't the team finish Module 1?"

Student Interaction:

• Click Button 1: "The Leader didn't give direction"

• Click Button 2: "The Organizer didn't prepare materials"

• Click Button 3: "Nobody listened to the Creator's ideas"

• Click Button 4: "The Supporter didn't help anyone"

• Click Button 5: "All of these problems"

Correct Answer: Button 5

System Feedback: "You observed all the problems! When roles aren't performed well-no direction, unprepared materials, ignored ideas, no support-the team can't function. Let's see what happens when everyone does their role well."

**Animation Sequence B: Good Performance (20 seconds)**

Scene shows team building Module 1 again:

• Alex (Leader): "Team, let's build the solar panels first, then connect them!"

◦ Clear direction, confident

• Jordan (Organizer): "I have all the panels ready and organized by size!"

◦ Materials laid out neatly, checking clipboard

• Sam (Creator): "I have an idea-let's arrange them in a star pattern for maximum energy!"

◦ Shows sketch, team looks at it

• Taylor (Supporter): "Great idea, Sam! Alex, that's a clear plan. Jordan, thanks for preparing everything. I'll help connect the panels!"

◦ Actively helping, encouraging everyone

Result: Module 1 complete, stable and functional, team high-fives, stars light up on module

Student Analysis Question: "What made the difference? Why did the team succeed this time?"

Student Interaction:

• Click Button 1: "Everyone did their role"

• Click Button 2: "They listened to each other"

• Click Button 3: "Each role was important for success"

• Click Button 4: "All of these reasons"

Correct Answer: Button 4

System Feedback: "You discovered the key! When everyone performs their role AND listens to each other, the team accomplishes its goal. Each role contributed something necessary-direction, preparation, ideas, and support."

**ROUND 2: Building Module 2 - Which Role is Missing?**

Setup Phase:

• Screen shows: "Module 2: Living Quarters"

• Text: "This time, one role won't do their job. Can you identify which role is missing?"

• Blueprint of living quarters displayed

Animation Sequence (20 seconds):

Scene shows team attempting to build:

• Alex (Leader): "Team, let's build the living quarters with bedrooms on the left, kitchen on the right!"

◦ Giving clear direction ✓

• Jordan (Organizer): "I have all the wall panels, windows, and doors organized and ready!"

◦ Materials prepared ✓

• Sam (Creator): "What if we add a skylight for natural light? Here's my design!"

◦ Shows creative solution ✓

• Taylor (Supporter): Silent, arms crossed, not helping anyone, looks disengaged

◦ No encouragement, no assistance ✗

Result: Module 2 gets built, but team looks tired and discouraged. Alex struggles alone to connect a panel. Sam's idea is implemented but Sam looks uncertain if it was good. Jordan looks stressed doing everything alone.

Student Analysis Question: "Which role didn't do their job? What was missing?"

Student Interaction:

• Click Button 1: "Leader-no direction was given"

• Click Button 2: "Organizer-materials weren't ready"

• Click Button 3: "Creator-no ideas were shared"

• Click Button 4: "Supporter-nobody helped or encouraged the team"

Correct Answer: Button 4

System Feedback: "You identified the missing role! Even though the module got built, the team felt discouraged without support. The Supporter role-helping others and encouraging the team-is just as necessary as leading, organizing, and creating. Without it, teams feel tired and less motivated."

Follow-up Question: "What happens in team members' three mind parts when the Supporter doesn't help?"

Student Interaction:

• Click Button 1: "Their Messengers (feeling) feel alone and discouraged"

• Click Button 2: "Their Idea Factories (thinking) think 'Nobody cares about my effort'"

• Click Button 3: "Their Action Players (doing) work less enthusiastically"

• Click Button 4: "All of these-it creates a negative loop"

Correct Answer: Button 4

System Feedback: "You discovered the loop! When nobody supports (Action Player missing) → team members feel discouraged (Messenger) → they think 'my work doesn't matter' (Idea Factory) → they do less enthusiastic work (Action Player) → the negative loop continues. That's why EVERY role, including Supporter, is necessary!"

**ROUND 3: Building Module 3 - Role Rotation & Listening Challenge**

Setup Phase:

• Screen shows: "Module 3: Science Lab"

• Text: "Now the team will switch roles! But there's a problem-they're not listening to each other. Watch what happens."

• Blueprint of science lab displayed

• Role rotation shown:

◦ Alex → now Organizer

◦ Jordan → now Creator

◦ Sam → now Supporter

◦ Taylor → now Leader

**Animation Sequence (25 seconds):**

Scene shows chaotic building attempt:

• Taylor (now Leader): "Let's build the lab with-"

◦ Alex interrupts: "No, I think we should-"

• Alex (now Organizer): "I have the materials but-"

◦ Jordan interrupts: "Wait, my design is better-"

• Jordan (now Creator): "If we design it like-"

◦ Sam interrupts: "No, I want to-"

• Sam (now Supporter): "Maybe we could-"

◦ Taylor interrupts: "Just listen to me!"

Result: Everyone talking at once, nobody listening, confused expressions, materials scattered, module incomplete, chaos on screen

Student Analysis Question: "The team had all four roles filled. Why did they fail?"

Student Interaction:

• Click Button 1: "They didn't have the right people in the roles"

• Click Button 2: "They didn't listen to each other"

• Click Button 3: "They interrupted instead of taking turns"

• Click Button 4: "Both Button 2 and Button 3"

Correct Answer: Button 4

System Feedback: "You identified the critical problem! Having all four roles isn't enough-team members must LISTEN and TAKE TURNS speaking. When everyone talks at once and interrupts, even a complete team can't function. Listening is the skill that makes roles work together."

**Animation Sequence B: Same Roles, With Listening (25 seconds)**

Scene shows team trying again with same role assignments:

• Taylor (Leader): "Let's build the lab with equipment on the left-" (pauses)

◦ Alex listens, nods

• Alex (Organizer): "I have all the science equipment ready!" (pauses)

◦ Jordan listens, waits turn

• Jordan (Creator): "What if we create a window between the lab and observation room?" (pauses)

◦ Sam listens, considers

• Sam (Supporter): "Great idea, Jordan! Taylor, clear plan. Alex, nice preparation. Let me help connect the equipment!"

◦ Everyone looks included and valued

Result: Module 3 complete, beautiful science lab with observation window, team looks happy and coordinated, high-fives all around

Student Analysis Question: "Same people, same roles-but this time they succeeded! What changed?"

Student Interaction:

• Click Button 1: "They listened to each other"

• Click Button 2: "They took turns speaking"

• Click Button 3: "They respected each other's ideas"

• Click Button 4: "All of these listening skills"

Correct Answer: Button 4

System Feedback: "You discovered that listening, turn-taking, and respect are what make roles work together! The team had all the same people in all the same roles-but when they used listening skills, everything changed. This is how the three mind parts create teamwork loops through listening."

Follow-up Question: "How does listening create loops between team members' mind parts?"

Student Interaction:

• Click Button 1: "When your Action Player listens (doing) → your partner's Messenger feels heard (feeling) → their Idea Factory opens up (thinking) → their Action Player shares more ideas (doing) → creates a positive loop!"

• Click Button 2: "Listening doesn't affect other people's mind parts"

• Click Button 3: "Only the Idea Factory matters during teamwork"

Correct Answer: Button 1

System Feedback: "You discovered the listening loop! When YOU listen (your Action Player), it changes what happens in your PARTNER'S three mind parts-they feel valued, think more openly, and share more. Your listening action creates loops in other people! That's the power of teamwork skills."

**ROUND 4: Building Module 4 - You Choose the Role Assignment**

Setup Phase:

**ROUND 5: Reflection & Application**

Final Analysis Questions:

Question 1: "Which role is MOST important in a team?"

• Click Button 1: Leader

• Click Button 2: Organizer

• Click Button 3: Creator

• Click Button 4: Supporter

• Click Button 5: All roles are equally important

Correct Answer: Button 5

System Feedback: "You discovered the key principle! ALL roles are equally important. Without the Leader, there's no direction. Without the Organizer, there's no preparation. Without the Creator, there's no innovation. Without the Supporter, there's no encouragement. Teams need every single role."

Question 2: "Can one person do all four roles by themselves?"

• Click Button 1: "Yes, one person can lead, organize, create, and support all at once"

• Click Button 2: "No, it's too much for one person-that's why teams share roles"

• Click Button 3: "Maybe, but only if they're really smart"

Correct Answer: Button 2

System Feedback: "You observed the truth! While one person might try to do everything, it's overwhelming and inefficient. Strong teams DISTRIBUTE responsibility-everyone plays a part, and that's what makes teams powerful. Sharing roles is how teamwork works."

Question 3: "What skill makes all four roles work together?"

• Click Button 1: Being the loudest

• Click Button 2: Being the fastest

• Click Button 3: Listening to each other and taking turns

• Click Button 4: Working alone without talking

Correct Answer: Button 3

System Feedback: "You identified the connecting skill! Listening and turn-taking are what allow four different roles to coordinate. Without listening, even a team with all four roles filled will struggle. Listening is the glue that holds teamwork together."

Question 4: "Think about YOUR three mind parts. Which role do YOU think you might be good at?"

• Click Button 1: Leader (making plans, giving direction)

• Click Button 2: Organizer (preparing materials, keeping order)

• Click Button 3: Creator (thinking of ideas, designing solutions)

• Click Button 4: Supporter (helping others, encouraging teammates)

• Click Button 5: I could try any of these roles!

No Correct Answer-All responses celebrated:

System Feedback (customized based on choice):

• Button 1: "Leaders help teams know what to do! Your Idea Factory makes plans, your Action Player gives direction, and your Messenger feels confident guiding others."

• Button 2: "Organizers keep teams prepared! Your Idea Factory thinks about what's needed, your Action Player arranges materials, and your Messenger feels satisfied when everything's ready."

• Button 3: "Creators generate new solutions! Your Idea Factory thinks creatively, your Action Player designs and builds, and your Messenger feels excited about possibilities."

• Button 4: "Supporters strengthen teams! Your Idea Factory notices what others need, your Action Player helps and encourages, and your Messenger feels connected to teammates."

• Button 5: "Flexible team members can try all roles! Your three mind parts can adapt-you can lead, organize, create, or support depending on what your team needs."

4\. "When roles coordinate well, teams accomplish amazing things!"

• Options: "Play Mission Again" or "Return to Lesson"

**Continuity Note**

Connection to Lesson Flow:

• Position in Lesson: Played after PRACTICE B (In-Class Experiment - "What Happens When We Don't Listen?")

• Reinforces: Students have just physically experienced the difference between listening/not listening during tower-building; this game extends that concrete experience into role differentiation and shows WHY listening matters-it's what makes different roles coordinate

• Uses Same Avatars: Alex, Jordan, Sam, and Taylor from Lesson 1 maintain continuity-students see the same team members now performing specific roles, reinforcing that teamwork is a progressive skill

Bridge to Lesson 3:

• This game establishes that teams need different roles AND listening skills to function

• Lesson 3 will address what happens when teams face the inevitable challenges-disagreements, mistakes, conflicts-and will show that the same listening and role-coordination skills become problem-solving tools

• Students will recognize that the roles they learned (Leader proposes solutions, Organizer prepares for fixes, Creator thinks of alternatives, Supporter encourages during difficulty) apply to conflict resolution

Connection to Unit Arc:

• Lesson 1 established WHAT teamwork is (combining efforts)

• Lesson 2 reveals HOW teamwork works mechanically (distributed roles + listening)

• Prepares for Lesson 3 (using these same skills when problems arise) and Lesson 4 (celebrating these coordinated efforts)

**Estimated Play Time**

9-10 minutes

• Introduction (Meet the Roles): 1 minute

• Round 1 (Good vs. Poor Performance + Analysis): 2 minutes

• Round 2 (Missing Role + Mind Parts Loop): 2 minutes

• Round 3 (Listening Challenge + Loop Discovery): 2.5 minutes

## In-Class-Game 10C – The Rescue Squad

## Lesson 3: Solving Problems as a Team

**Lesson Link & Learning Objective**

Students will understand that disagreements and challenges are normal in teamwork, and will apply cooperative problem-solving strategies (listening, sharing feelings, finding compromises, agreeing on plans) to move through conflict productively.

**Game File Name: icg-10.03-game01.html**

**Game Title: The Rescue Squad**

**Game Format**: Interactive Branching Scenario with Consequence Mapping

This format combines:

• Decision-point storytelling where student choices determine outcomes

• A/B comparison showing parallel universes (same problem, different approaches, different results)

• Pattern recognition across multiple conflict scenarios (identifying which strategies work vs. fail)

• Cause-and-effect chains linking communication choices to team outcomes

**Justification**: This format directly mirrors the lesson's focus on cooperative problem-solving by placing students in realistic team conflicts where they must choose strategies and observe consequences. By seeing the SAME conflict resolved two different ways (productive vs. unproductive), students discover through comparison-not instruction-that listening, compromising, and respectful communication are what transform conflicts from team-breakers into team-strengtheners. The branching structure demonstrates that conflict outcomes aren't random-they're determined by the strategies teams choose.

**Purpose**: Students discover that team problems are inevitable, but teams control how they respond. The game demonstrates that unproductive conflict patterns (arguing, not listening, refusing to compromise) break teams apart, while productive patterns (listening, expressing feelings respectfully, finding compromises) make teams stronger and more resilient.

**Placement in Lesson Arc**: After PRACTICE A (Psychology Experiment - "Listening vs. Not Listening" via MindMaster prediction scenarios) (13 minutes into Explore + Practice section)

**Pedagogical Justification**: The game's mid-sequence placement serves as a pivotal bridge in the lesson's learning progression from Prediction to Application: Practice A had students predict outcomes of listening vs. not listening in simple scenarios. The game now applies these predictions to complex, realistic conflict situations (equipment disputes, mistakes, disagreements, communication breakdowns). A/B Comparison Power: The game's unique format (showing Path A and Path B for the SAME problem) demonstrates causality clearly. Students see that outcomes aren't random-they're determined by team strategies. This wouldn't resonate without the prediction practice establishing that different approaches yield different results. > Preparation for Practice C: By placing the game before Practice C (the "What's the Smart Move?" quiz), students have rich examples to draw from. The quiz becomes a reflection on patterns observed in the game rather than abstract questioning.

Emotional Engagement: The rescue squad theme and branching scenarios create emotional investment that sustains attention through the remaining activities. Placing it mid-lesson maintains energy.

**Setup**

Opening Screen:

• Title: "Rescue Squad: Save the Day Together"

• Background: Emergency response headquarters with mission board showing incoming rescue calls

• Visual style: Bright, action-oriented cartoon aesthetic with rescue/emergency theme

• Text: "You're part of an emergency rescue squad! Teams face problems and challenges-that's normal. What matters is HOW you solve them. Let's discover which problem-solving strategies make teams stronger!"

• Button: "Start First Mission" (any clicker button to begin)

Character Avatars (NEW characters for variety, but similar cartoon style):

• Rescue Squad Team:

◦ Nova (purple rescue uniform, medic gear)

◦ Dash (orange rescue uniform, speed equipment)

◦ Sky (teal rescue uniform, aerial tools)

◦ Rocky (brown rescue uniform, strength gear)

• Different avatars from Lessons 1-2 to provide visual variety while maintaining unit consistency

Mission Setup Display:

• Shows emergency response map with 4 rescue missions

• Each mission will present a team conflict

• Student will choose how the team responds

• System will show what happens with that choice

**Play**

**INTRODUCTION: Problems Are Normal (1 minute)**

Screen Display:

• Shows Rescue Squad team at headquarters

• Mission alert flashing on screen

• Text: "Even the best teams face problems! Disagreements, mistakes, and challenges happen. What makes a rescue squad strong isn't avoiding problems-it's solving them TOGETHER."

Brief Animation (15 seconds):

• Shows various mini-conflicts in thought bubbles:

◦ Two team members wanting the same equipment

◦ Someone making a mistake during a rescue

◦ Team members disagreeing about which route to take

◦ Someone's feelings getting hurt

• Text: "Let's see how different problem-solving strategies lead to different outcomes!"

**MISSION 1: The Equipment Conflict**

Setup Screen:

• Mission Alert: "Cat stuck in tree! Quick rescue needed!"

• Shows team gearing up

• Conflict appears: Nova and Dash both reach for the only available rescue ladder at the same time

• Speech bubbles:

◦ Nova: "I need the ladder!"

◦ Dash: "No, I need it!"

• Text: "Both team members need the same equipment. How should they solve this problem?"

**CHOICE POINT - Path A vs. Path B**

Student sees two parallel scenarios side-by-side on screen:

Left Side - Path A: Arguing Without Listening Right Side - Path B: Listening and Compromising

Text: "Watch what happens with each approach. Then decide which strategy works better."

**Path A Animation (20 seconds):**

Left side of screen shows:

• Nova: "I grabbed it first! It's mine!"

• Dash: "No way! I'm faster, I should use it!"

• Both pull on ladder, arguing loudly

• Other team members (Sky and Rocky) look uncomfortable, don't know what to do

• Time passes (clock ticking)

• Cat in tree meowing desperately

• Ladder breaks from both pulling on it

• Mission timer runs out - MISSION FAILED

• Team looks frustrated and defeated

• Text overlay: "Cat still stuck. Team angry. Equipment broken."

**Path B Animation (20 seconds):**

Right side of screen shows:

• Nova (takes breath): "I feel frustrated because I need the ladder."

• Dash (listens): "I understand. I need it too. What if we work together?"

• Nova: "Good idea! You're faster-you climb while I hold the ladder steady!"

• Dash: "Perfect! That uses both our strengths!"

• Both coordinate: Dash climbs quickly, Nova stabilizes

• Cat rescued safely

• High-five between Nova and Dash

• Mission timer: SUCCESS with time to spare

• Team celebrates together

• Text overlay: "Cat rescued! Team stronger! Compromise worked!"

Student Analysis Question: "You observed the SAME problem solved two different ways. Which approach made the team stronger?"

Student Interaction:

• Click Button 1: "Path A (Arguing) made the team stronger"

• Click Button 2: "Path B (Listening and Compromising) made the team stronger"

• Click Button 3: "Both paths worked equally well"

Correct Answer: Button 2

System Feedback: "You discovered the key difference! Path A (arguing without listening) broke the equipment, failed the mission, and left the team frustrated. Path B (listening and compromising) rescued the cat, succeeded quickly, AND made the team feel capable together. Same problem-completely different outcomes based on the strategy chosen."

Follow-up Question: "What happened in Nova and Dash's three mind parts during Path B (listening and compromising)?"

Student Interaction:

• Click Button 1: "Their Messengers felt heard and respected (feeling)"

• Click Button 2: "Their Idea Factories thought of a creative solution together (thinking)"

• Click Button 3: "Their Action Players coordinated their movements (doing)"

• Click Button 4: "All three parts worked in a positive loop"

Correct Answer: Button 4

System Feedback: "You observed the problem-solving loop! When Nova expressed feelings respectfully and Dash listened (Action Player) → both felt respected (Messenger) → they could think clearly together (Idea Factory) → they coordinated actions (Action Player) → mission succeeded (feeling proud) → thinking 'we're a strong team' → wanting to work together more. That's how productive conflict resolution creates positive loops!"

**MISSION 2: The Mistake**

Setup Screen:

• Mission Alert: "River rescue! Person stranded on island!"

• Shows team arriving at river with rescue boat

• Conflict appears: Rocky was supposed to bring life jackets but forgot them

• Dash (upset): "Rocky! We can't rescue anyone without life jackets! You messed up!"

• Rocky (looks embarrassed and sad): "I'm sorry... I forgot..."

• Text: "A team member made a mistake. How should the team respond?"

**CHOICE POINT - Two Paths**

Left Side - Path A: Blaming and Getting Angry Right Side - Path B: Staying Calm and Problem-Solving

**Path A Animation (20 seconds):**

Left side shows:

• Dash: "This is YOUR fault, Rocky! You ruined everything!"

• Nova: "We can't trust you with important jobs!"

• Sky: "Why didn't you check before we left?!"

• Rocky (head down, tears in eyes): "I said I'm sorry..."

• Team stands around arguing and blaming

• Person on island still stranded, waving for help

• Mission timer runs out - MISSION FAILED

• Rocky walks away from team, feeling terrible

• Text overlay: "Person still stranded. Rocky feels awful. Team broken."

**Path B Animation (20 seconds):**

Right side shows:

• Dash (takes breath): "I feel worried because we need life jackets. But mistakes happen."

• Nova: "Rocky, are you okay? Everyone forgets sometimes."

• Rocky: "I feel really bad. I'm sorry I let you down."

• Sky: "Let's solve this together. What can we do?"

• Dash: "I have rope! We can throw it from shore!"

• Nova: "And we can form a human chain for stability!"

• Team works together using rope method

• Person rescued safely using teamwork

• Rocky: "Thanks for not giving up on me."

• Team: "We're a team-we solve problems together!"

• Mission SUCCESS

• Text overlay: "Person rescued! Rocky feels supported! Team trust stronger!"

Student Analysis Question: "Why did Path B succeed even though Rocky made the same mistake in both paths?"

Student Interaction:

• Click Button 1: "Path B team blamed Rocky less, so the mistake disappeared"

• Click Button 2: "Path B team stayed calm, showed understanding, and focused on solving the problem together"

• Click Button 3: "Path B team had better equipment from the start"

• Click Button 4: "Rocky didn't actually make a mistake in Path B"

Correct Answer: Button 2

System Feedback: "You identified the critical difference! The mistake was the SAME in both paths-Rocky forgot the life jackets. What changed was the team's RESPONSE. Path A blamed and got angry, which broke the team apart and no one solved the problem. Path B stayed calm, showed understanding, and immediately shifted to 'how do we solve this together?'-and they found a creative solution. Productive teams don't avoid mistakes; they solve problems cooperatively when mistakes happen."

Follow-up Question: "In Path A (blaming), what loop happened in Rocky's three mind parts?"

Student Interaction:

• Click Button 1: "Messenger felt terrible → Idea Factory thought 'I'm bad at this' → Action Player withdrew from team → negative loop"

• Click Button 2: "Messenger felt happy → Idea Factory thought clearly → Action Player helped more"

• Click Button 3: "Nothing happened in Rocky's mind parts"

Correct Answer: Button 1

System Feedback: "You observed the negative loop! When the team blamed Rocky (what they did) → Rocky's Messenger felt awful → Rocky's Idea Factory thought 'I'm not good enough' → Rocky's Action Player withdrew and couldn't help anymore. Blaming creates negative loops that weaken teams. In Path B, the team's supportive response (Action Player: 'mistakes happen, let's solve this') created a POSITIVE loop where Rocky could help find the solution!"

**MISSION 3: The Disagreement**

Setup Screen:

• Mission Alert: "Building collapse! People trapped inside!"

• Shows team arriving at collapsed building with two possible entry points

• Conflict appears: Nova and Sky disagree about which entrance to use

• Speech bubbles:

◦ Nova: "We should go through the front entrance-it's closer!"

◦ Sky: "No! The side entrance is safer-less debris!"

◦ Dash: "We need to decide NOW. People are trapped!"

• Text: "Two team members have different ideas. Both could work. How should they handle the disagreement?"

**CHOICE POINT - Two Paths**

Left Side - Path A: Refusing to Listen, Fighting About Who's Right Right Side - Path B: Listening to Both Ideas, Then Deciding Together

**Path A Animation (25 seconds):**

Left side shows:

• Nova: "My idea is better! We're using the front entrance!"

• Sky: "That's dangerous! We're using the side entrance!"

• Nova: "Stop arguing with me! I know what I'm doing!"

• Sky: "You're not listening! You never listen!"

• Both talk over each other, voices getting louder

• Dash and Rocky stand frozen, unsure what to do

• No one enters either entrance-team paralyzed by argument

• Mission timer runs out - MISSION FAILED

• Text overlay: "People still trapped. Team couldn't act. Trust damaged."

**Path B Animation (25 seconds):**

Right side shows:

• Rocky: "Wait-let's listen to both ideas before deciding."

• Nova: "Okay. I think front entrance is faster. Time matters."

• Sky: "I hear you. I think side entrance has less falling debris-safer."

• Dash: "Both are good points. What if Sky checks the side entrance safety, while Nova times the front route? We choose the best one based on what we see?"

• Nova and Sky: "That's fair!"

• Quick check shows side entrance is actually clearer

• Nova: "You were right, Sky. Let's use side entrance."

• Sky: "Thanks for being open to my idea!"

• Team enters safely, rescues people successfully

• Mission SUCCESS with cooperation

• Text overlay: "People rescued! Team made decision together! Respect increased!"

Student Analysis Question: "What was the KEY difference between Path A and Path B?"

Student Interaction:

• Click Button 1: "Path A had a worse plan than Path B"

• Click Button 2: "Path A team fought about who was right; Path B team listened to both ideas and decided together"

• Click Button 3: "Nova and Sky had different personalities in each path"

• Click Button 4: "Path A took longer to discuss the problem"

Correct Answer: Button 2

System Feedback: "You discovered the problem-solving principle! In BOTH paths, Nova and Sky disagreed-that's normal! The difference was HOW they handled it. Path A: each person fought to prove they were right, refused to listen, and the team couldn't act. Path B: both people shared their reasoning, listened to each other, and made a GROUP decision. The disagreement wasn't the problem-refusing to listen and compromise was the problem."

Follow-up Question: "Why did Path B make the team STRONGER even though they disagreed?"

Student Interaction:

• Click Button 1: "Because they avoided the disagreement"

• Click Button 2: "Because one person gave in immediately"

• Click Button 3: "Because they solved the disagreement together by listening, respecting different ideas, and making a joint decision"

• Click Button 4: "Disagreements always make teams weaker"

Correct Answer: Button 3

System Feedback: "You discovered something important about teamwork! Disagreements don't weaken teams-refusing to solve them cooperatively weakens teams. Path B team respected both perspectives, listened carefully, gathered information together, and reached a decision everyone accepted. That built MORE trust and respect because everyone felt heard and valued. Solving problems together makes teams MORE resilient, not less!"

**MISSION 4: The Communication Breakdown**

Setup Screen:

• Mission Alert: "Wildfire approaching town! Evacuate residents!"

• Shows team coordinating evacuation with multiple tasks needed simultaneously

• Conflict appears: Everyone starts doing different things without discussing the plan

• Visual chaos:

◦ Nova runs to one neighborhood without telling anyone

◦ Dash grabs evacuation bus without coordinating

◦ Sky heads toward fire to check spread, no one knows where Sky went

◦ Rocky starts setting up shelter, unclear if that's the priority

• Text: "The team has a big task with many parts. But no one communicated the plan. What happens?"

**CHOICE POINT - Two Paths**

Left Side - Path A: No Communication, Everyone Does Their Own Thing Right Side - Path B: Stop, Plan Together, Then Coordinate

**Path A Animation (25 seconds):**

Left side shows:

• All four team members running in different directions

• No one knows what others are doing

• Nova evacuates one house, but Dash already drove the bus away-Nova's family has no transport

• Sky reports fire spread to empty headquarters-no one there to hear it

• Rocky sets up shelter at evacuation point, but no one brings people there

• Everyone working hard individually but nothing connects

• Confusion, frustration, inefficiency

• Evacuation incomplete when fire arrives

• Mission FAILED

• Team exhausted and discouraged

• Text overlay: "Evacuation incomplete. Hard work wasted. Team disconnected."

**Path B Animation (25 seconds):**

Right side shows:

• Rocky: "WAIT! Let's make a plan together first!"

• All four gather in quick huddle (10 seconds at most)

• Nova: "I'll go door-to-door in north neighborhood."

• Dash: "I'll drive evacuation bus. Nova, radio me when families are ready."

• Sky: "I'll monitor fire and update everyone on spread."

• Rocky: "I'll set up shelter and coordinate arrivals."

• All: "Everyone understand the plan?" (Thumbs up all around)

• Team executes coordinated plan:

◦ Nova radios when families ready → Dash arrives with bus exactly when needed

◦ Sky updates everyone on fire spread → team adjusts timing together

◦ Rocky prepares shelter → everyone arrives at the right place

• Complete, efficient, coordinated evacuation

• Mission SUCCESS

• Team celebrates coordinated effort

• Text overlay: "Everyone evacuated safely! Coordinated teamwork! Communication worked!"

Student Analysis Question: "Why did Path A fail even though everyone worked hard?"

Student Interaction:

• Click Button 1: "The team members weren't skilled enough"

• Click Button 2: "They didn't communicate and coordinate, so their hard work didn't connect"

• Click Button 3: "The mission was impossible"

• Click Button 4: "They needed more team members"

Correct Answer: Button 2

System Feedback: "You identified the problem! Path A team worked HARD-but without communication and coordination, their efforts didn't connect. Nova evacuated families but no bus came. Sky got important information but no one heard it. Rocky prepared shelter but no one brought people there. Path B team took 10 seconds to PLAN together first, then their actions coordinated perfectly. Communication and planning are problem-solving strategies that make individual efforts add up to team success."

Follow-up Question: "What happened in each team member's mind parts during Path B's quick planning huddle?"

Student Interaction:

• Click Button 1: "Each person's Idea Factory shared their plan (thinking) → Everyone's Action Player listened and coordinated (doing) → Everyone's Messenger felt clear and confident (feeling) → Created positive teamwork loops!"

• Click Button 2: "Only the leader's mind parts mattered during planning"

• Click Button 3: "Planning doesn't involve the three mind parts"

Correct Answer: Button 1

System Feedback: "You observed the communication loop! During that quick planning huddle, ALL team members used their three mind parts together: Idea Factories shared plans → Action Players listened and spoke → Messengers felt confident and connected → created clear coordination. That 10-second investment in communication created loops that made the whole mission succeed. Problem-solving starts with communication-and communication engages all three mind parts in everyone!"

**FINAL ROUND: Pattern Recognition & Application**

Setup Screen:

• Shows all 4 completed missions on mission board

• Text: "You observed 4 different team problems and saw how different strategies led to different outcomes. Now let's see what you discovered about solving problems as a team!"

Pattern Recognition Questions:

Question 1: "What do ALL the successful paths (Path B scenarios) have in common?"

Student Interaction:

• Click Button 1: "Team members listened to each other"

• Click Button 2: "Team members expressed feelings respectfully"

• Click Button 3: "Team members found compromises and made plans together"

• Click Button 4: "All of these problem-solving strategies"

Correct Answer: Button 4

System Feedback: "You discovered the problem-solving pattern! Across all four successful missions, the team used the SAME strategies: listening carefully to different perspectives, expressing feelings respectfully (not blaming), and finding compromises or shared plans. These strategies work for equipment conflicts, mistakes, disagreements, and communication breakdowns. They're universal problem-solving tools!"

Question 2: "What do ALL the failed paths (Path A scenarios) have in common?"

Student Interaction:

• Click Button 1: "Team members argued without listening"

• Click Button 2: "Team members blamed or refused to compromise"

• Click Button 3: "Team members didn't communicate or coordinate"

• Click Button 4: "All of these unproductive patterns"

Correct Answer: Button 4

System Feedback: "You identified the failure pattern! Across all four failed missions, teams used unproductive strategies: arguing without listening, blaming instead of solving, refusing to compromise, or not communicating. These patterns broke teams apart and failed missions. Notice that the PROBLEMS weren't the issue-every team faced challenges. What mattered was whether they used productive or unproductive strategies to respond."

Question 3: "Are team problems and disagreements normal?"

Student Interaction:

• Click Button 1: "No-good teams never have problems or disagreements"

• Click Button 2: "Yes-all teams face problems. Strong teams solve them cooperatively"

• Click Button 3: "Problems mean the team should give up"

Correct Answer: Button 2

System Feedback: "You discovered a key truth about teamwork! EVERY team-even rescue squads-faces problems, mistakes, and disagreements. That's completely normal. What makes teams strong isn't avoiding problems (impossible!), but having the skills to solve them together. When teams use listening, respectful communication, and compromise, problems actually make them STRONGER and more resilient because they learn to trust each other through challenges."

Question 4: "Think about YOUR three mind parts. When you face a team problem, which strategy helps create positive loops?"

Student Interaction:

• Click Button 1: "Action Player: Argue loudly until you win → Messenger: Feel frustrated → Idea Factory: Think 'they're wrong' → Negative loop"

• Click Button 2: "Action Player: Listen and express feelings respectfully → Messenger: Feel heard and calm → Idea Factory: Think clearly and find solutions → Positive loop!"

• Click Button 3: "Action Player: Avoid the problem → Messenger: Feel anxious → Idea Factory: Think 'I can't handle this' → Negative loop"

Correct Answer: Button 2

System Feedback: "You discovered your problem-solving power! When YOU choose to listen and communicate respectfully (Action Player choice), it changes your OWN feelings (Messenger: calm instead of frustrated) and thinking (Idea Factory: solution-focused instead of stuck), AND it changes your TEAMMATE'S mind parts too-they feel heard, think more openly, and cooperate more. Your choice to use productive problem-solving strategies creates positive loops for yourself AND your team. That's your power during conflicts!"

Question 5: "Imagine you're on a team at school. Two teammates disagree about how to do a project. What should YOU do?"

Student Interaction:

• Click Button 1: "Take one person's side immediately"

• Click Button 2: "Say 'Let's listen to both ideas, then decide together as a team'"

• Click Button 3: "Walk away and let them figure it out"

• Click Button 4: "Tell them to stop disagreeing"

Correct Answer: Button 2

System Feedback: "You know how to be a problem-solving team member! When teammates disagree, you can help by suggesting they listen to BOTH perspectives and make a decision together-just like the Rescue Squad did in Mission 3. You don't have to be the leader to help solve team problems. ANY team member can suggest productive strategies like listening, compromising, and planning together. That makes YOU a valuable problem-solver!"

**Continuity Note**

Connection to Lesson Flow:

• Position in Lesson: Played after PRACTICE A (Psychology Experiment - "Listening vs. Not Listening" via MindMaster prediction scenarios)

• Reinforces: Students have just predicted and observed outcomes from listening vs. not listening; this game extends that into realistic conflict scenarios with multiple problem types (equipment conflicts, mistakes, disagreements, communication breakdowns)

• New Avatars: Uses different characters (Rescue Squad) from Lessons 1-2 to provide visual variety, but maintains similar cartoon style and structure to show that teamwork principles apply across different teams and contexts

Bridge to Lesson 4:

• This game establishes that solving problems together builds trust, respect, and resilience

• Lesson 4 will show that CELEBRATING these collective achievements-recognizing the shared effort of working through challenges-is what completes the teamwork cycle and makes teams want to cooperate again

• Students will recognize that the conflicts they solved (equipment sharing, mistakes, disagreements, coordination) are all accomplishments worth celebrating as team successes, not individual victories

Connection to Unit Arc:

• Lesson 1 established WHAT teamwork is (combining efforts toward shared goals)

• Lesson 2 revealed HOW teamwork works (distributed roles + listening skills)

• Lesson 3 shows WHEN teamwork matters most (during challenges and conflicts-not just easy tasks)

• Prepares for Lesson 4: teams that solve problems together have achievements worth celebrating collectively

Connection to Previous Lessons:

• Uses same three mind parts framework (Idea Factory, Messenger, Action Player, loops) established in Lessons 1-2

• Applies listening skills from Lesson 2 specifically to conflict situations

• Shows that roles from Lesson 2 (Leader, Organizer, Creator, Supporter) all contribute to problem-solving

**Estimated Play Time**

9-10 minutes

• Introduction (Problems Are Normal): 1 minute

• Mission 1 (Equipment Conflict) + Analysis: 2 minutes

• Mission 2 (The Mistake) + Analysis: 2 minutes

• Mission 3 (The Disagreement) + Analysis: 2 minutes

## In-Class-Game 10D – Festival of Teams

**Lesson 4: Celebrating What We Achieve Together**

**Lesson Link & Learning Objective**

Students will understand that celebrating collective achievements strengthens team connection and belonging, and will recognize that appreciation for shared effort-not individual winning-is what makes cooperation meaningful and rewarding.

**Game File Name: icg-10.04-game01.html**

**Game Title: Festival of Teams**

**Game Format:** Emotional Impact Simulator with Before/After Comparison

This format combines:

• Interactive simulation where students observe team reactions to different types of recognition

• Emotional state tracking showing how celebration styles affect team members' feelings, motivation, and desire to cooperate again

• Experimental manipulation where the SAME achievement is celebrated in different ways, producing different team outcomes

• Pattern discovery across multiple team scenarios (sports, arts, building, problem-solving)

**Justification**: This format directly mirrors the lesson's focus on how celebration creates team connection by making the EFFECTS of different recognition styles visible and measurable. By observing how individual recognition vs. collective celebration changes team members' emotional states and motivation to cooperate again, students discover through observation-not instruction-that HOW teams celebrate determines whether cooperation feels rewarding. The format treats celebration as a psychological variable with measurable effects on team functioning, maintaining the psychology-as-science framework.

**Purpose:** Students discover that the TYPE of celebration after teamwork-individual recognition ("you're the best") vs. collective celebration ("we achieved this together")-creates completely different effects on team members' feelings, sense of belonging, and motivation to cooperate in the future. The game demonstrates that collective celebration strengthens teams while excessive individual recognition can weaken team bonds.

**Placement in Lesson Arc**: Embedded throughout PRACTICE A and PRACTICE B activities (the game IS the primary vehicle for experiments and scenarios) (10 minutes into Explore + Practice section)

**Pedagogical Justification**: Unlike other lessons, this game functions as the central experimental platform rather than a supplementary activity. As the final lesson, the game serves as a synthesis tool, bringing back familiar characters (Alex, Jordan, Sam, Taylor) and demonstrating the complete teamwork cycle they've learned across all four lessons.

- Experimental Methodology: The game IS Practice A's psychology experiment ("Does Recognition Change Motivation?"). By making the game the experiment itself, students engage with scientific observation through an immersive medium, seeing cause-effect relationships in team motivation.
- Comparative Analysis Framework: The game's format (showing Experiment A vs. Experiment B for the same achievement) teaches scientific thinking-controlling variables (same team, same achievement) while manipulating one factor (celebration type) to observe effects.
- Emotional Closure: The festival theme and return of beloved characters creates emotional resonance for unit completion. Students see the characters' growth journey mirroring their own learning progression.
- Meta-Reflection: By observing teams at different stations celebrating achievements, students can reflect on their own class as a team that achieved something (learning about teamwork), creating a powerful meta-moment where the lesson's content mirrors the lesson's process.
- Integration Over Isolation: Rather than placing a game after other activities, making the game the primary learning vehicle for this culminating lesson emphasizes that the principles they've learned are experiential and observable, not just theoretical.

**Setup**

Opening Screen:

• Title: "Festival of Teams: What Makes Us Want to Work Together Again?"

• Background: Festive celebration venue with four different team stations (each representing a different type of team achievement)

• Visual style: Bright, celebratory cartoon aesthetic with banners, confetti, achievement displays

• Text: "Teams work hard and accomplish amazing things! But HOW we celebrate makes a big difference. Let's discover what types of celebration make teams feel connected and want to work together again!"

• Mission: Discover which celebration approaches make teams stronger

**Play**

**INTRODUCTION: Why Celebration Matters (1 minute)**

Screen Display:

• Shows Festival entrance with four team stations visible in background

• Text: "Welcome to the Festival of Teams! Today we're celebrating four teams that accomplished amazing things. But we're also discovering something important about celebration itself..."

Brief Animation (20 seconds):

• Shows quick montage of four different teams completing achievements:

◦ Sports team scoring winning goal

◦ Art team finishing collaborative mural

◦ Building team completing tower

◦ Problem-solving team fixing broken equipment

• Text appears: "All four teams succeeded! But watch what happens when we celebrate their success in different ways. The TYPE of celebration will change how team members FEEL and whether they want to work together again."

Science Connection:

• Text: "This is a psychology experiment! We'll observe the SAME kind of achievement celebrated in different ways, then see how celebration affects team members' three mind parts-their feelings (Messenger), thoughts (Idea Factory), and future actions (Action Player). Let's discover which celebration creates the strongest teams!"

**STATION 1: The Victory Team - Sports Achievement**

Setup Screen:

• Shows Team Victory (four cartoon athletes) who just won a soccer match with excellent teamwork

• Team composition visible:

◦ Mia (goalkeeper who made crucial saves)

**EXPERIMENT A: Individual Recognition Only (25 seconds)**

Animation Sequence:

• Coach approaches team with trophy

• Coach: "Great game! Chen, you're the STAR! You scored the goals-you're the MVP! You're the best player on the team!"

• Chen receives big trophy and special recognition

• Camera zooms to show each team member's reaction:

Chen (who got recognized):

• Emotion indicator: Happy/proud

• Thought bubble: "I'm the best!"

• Body language: Standing tall, holding trophy alone

Mia (goalkeeper):

• Emotion indicator: Left out/sad

• Thought bubble: "My saves didn't matter?"

• Body language: Looking down, stepping back from group

Jamal (who assisted):

• Emotion indicator: Frustrated/invisible

• Thought bubble: "I helped too, but no one noticed..."

• Body language: Arms crossed, frowning

Ava (defender):

• Emotion indicator: Discouraged

• Thought bubble: "Why did I even try?"

• Body language: Shoulders slumped, looking away

Post-Celebration Survey (Visible on Screen):

• Question to team: "Do you want to play together again next week?"

• Results displayed:

◦ Chen: "Sure!" (happy to continue)

◦ Mia: "Maybe..." (uncertain)

◦ Jamal: "I guess..." (unenthusiastic)

◦ Ava: "Not really..." (discouraged)

• Team connection meter: 3/10 (LOW)

**EXPERIMENT B: Collective Celebration (25 seconds)**

Same team, same achievement, different celebration approach:

Animation Sequence:

• Coach approaches team with trophy

• Coach: "What an AMAZING TEAM! Chen, your goals were fantastic! Jamal, your assists set up those goals perfectly! Mia, your saves kept us in the game! Ava, your defense protected us! You worked together and WON together! This trophy belongs to all of you!"

• Trophy placed in center of team; all four hands on it together

• Camera zooms to show each team member's reaction:

Chen:

• Emotion indicator: Proud AND connected

• Thought bubble: "My teammates made this possible!"

• Body language: Smiling at teammates, sharing trophy

Mia:

• Emotion indicator: Valued/proud

• Thought bubble: "My work mattered to the team!"

• Body language: Standing with team, smiling

Jamal:

• Emotion indicator: Appreciated/happy

• Thought bubble: "We all contributed!"

• Body language: High-fiving teammates

Ava:

• Emotion indicator: Belonging/proud

• Thought bubble: "I'm an important part of this team!"

• Body language: Arms around teammates, celebrating together

Post-Celebration Survey:

• Question to team: "Do you want to play together again next week?"

• Results displayed:

◦ Chen: "Absolutely!" (enthusiastic)

◦ Mia: "Yes! Can't wait!" (excited)

◦ Jamal: "Definitely!" (motivated)

◦ Ava: "Yes! Love this team!" (connected)

• Team connection meter: 10/10 (HIGH)

Student Analysis Question: "The SAME team won the SAME match. What changed between Experiment A and Experiment B?"

Student Interaction:

• Click Button 1: "Different players scored in each experiment"

• Click Button 2: "The TYPE of celebration-individual recognition vs. collective celebration"

• Click Button 3: "The team tried harder in Experiment B"

• Click Button 4: "Nothing changed"

Correct Answer: Button 2

System Feedback: "You identified the key variable! The SAME team achieved the SAME victory-but the celebration was different. Experiment A celebrated only Chen (individual recognition). Experiment B celebrated the whole team's contributions (collective celebration). Watch what happened: Individual recognition made three team members feel left out and unmotivated. Collective celebration made ALL four members feel valued, connected, and eager to work together again. The celebration TYPE changed the team's future!"

Follow-up Question: "What happened in the team members' three mind parts during collective celebration (Experiment B)?"

Student Interaction:

• Click Button 1: "Each Messenger felt valued and connected (feeling)"

• Click Button 2: "Each Idea Factory thought 'I matter to this team' (thinking)"

• Click Button 3: "Each Action Player wants to contribute again (doing)"

• Click Button 4: "All three parts created positive loops in everyone"

Correct Answer: Button 4

System Feedback: "You observed the celebration loop! When the coach recognized EVERYONE's contributions (Action Player: what coach did) → each team member's Messenger felt valued → each Idea Factory thought 'I belong here and contribute meaningfully' → each Action Player became motivated to work with the team again → creates positive loops that make cooperation rewarding! Collective celebration doesn't just feel nice-it creates psychological loops that strengthen future teamwork."

**STATION 2: The Art Team - Creative Achievement**

Setup Screen:

• Shows Team Canvas (four cartoon artists) who just completed a beautiful collaborative mural

• Team composition visible:

• Emotion indicator: Focused on competition

• Thought bubble: "We have to win again next time!"

• Body language: Competitive stance, less interest in art itself

Post-Celebration Survey:

• Question: "Why do you want to make art together again?"

• Results displayed:

◦ Zara: "To win again, I guess?" (cooperation not the motivation)

◦ Marcus: "If we can beat others..." (conditional)

◦ Lily: "I feel bad about winning..." (negative feelings)

◦ Devon: "Only if we can be #1 again" (focused on competition, not teamwork)

• Team connection meter: 5/10 (MEDIUM-some motivation but not from cooperation itself)

**EXPERIMENT B: Celebrating Teamwork, Effort, and Growth (25 seconds)**

Same team, same mural, different celebration approach:

Animation Sequence:

• Art teacher approaches team with appreciation

• Teacher: "Look at what you created TOGETHER! Zara, your design vision brought us together. Marcus, your background work set the stage beautifully. Lily, your characters tell amazing stories. Devon, your finishing touches unified everything! You listened to each other's ideas, combined your different talents, and created something none of you could make alone. The way you worked together-that's what makes this special!"

• Team looks at their mural together with pride

• Other teams also celebrated for their own achievements (visible in background-everyone's work valued)

• Camera zooms to Team Canvas reactions:

Zara:

• Emotion indicator: Deeply proud

• Thought bubble: "We created something beautiful together!"

• Body language: Gesturing to explain the collaborative process

Lily:

• Emotion indicator: Belonging/proud

• Thought bubble: "Everyone's part mattered equally!"

• Body language: Smiling at teammates, arm around Devon

Devon:

• Emotion indicator: Valued/motivated

• Thought bubble: "I love creating with this team!"

• Body language: Already sketching ideas for next collaboration

Post-Celebration Survey:

• Question: "Why do you want to make art together again?"

• Results displayed:

◦ Zara: "Working together is so rewarding!" (cooperation itself is motivating)

◦ Marcus: "I love how we combine our strengths!" (focused on teamwork)

◦ Lily: "Everyone's ideas make our art better!" (values collaboration)

◦ Devon: "Can't wait to create together again!" (intrinsic motivation)

• Team connection meter: 10/10 (HIGH-cooperation itself feels rewarding)

Student Analysis Question: "Both experiments celebrated the SAME mural. Why did Experiment B create stronger team motivation?"

Student Interaction:

• Click Button 1: "Experiment B celebrated winning, which motivates teams"

• Click Button 2: "Experiment B celebrated the TEAMWORK, EFFORT, and how everyone contributed-not competing or being 'best'"

• Click Button 3: "The mural was better in Experiment B"

• Click Button 4: "The teacher was nicer in Experiment B"

Correct Answer: Button 2

System Feedback: "You discovered the celebration principle! Experiment A focused on WINNING and BEATING others-this made some team members uncomfortable and made cooperation feel like just a tool for competition. Experiment B focused on the TEAMWORK itself-how they listened, combined talents, and created together. This made cooperation feel rewarding for its own sake, not just for winning. When we celebrate teamwork and growth instead of 'being best,' teams want to cooperate because cooperation itself feels meaningful and valuable."

Follow-up Question: "Why is celebrating 'we worked together' more powerful than celebrating 'we won'?"

Student Interaction:

• Click Button 1: "Because winning is temporary, but teamwork skills last"

• Click Button 2: "Because celebrating cooperation makes it feel rewarding, so teams want to do it again"

• Click Button 3: "Because everyone feels included in cooperation, but not everyone feels good about competition"

• Click Button 4: "All of these reasons"

Correct Answer: Button 4

System Feedback: "You discovered why collective celebration of cooperation is so powerful! When we celebrate 'we worked together': (1) We're building teamwork skills that apply to future challenges, not just one-time wins. (2) We make cooperation itself feel good, creating motivation to cooperate again. (3) Everyone feels included and valued, strengthening belonging. Competition can motivate, but celebrating COOPERATION creates lasting team bonds and makes teamwork rewarding even without 'winning.'"

**STATION 3: The Builder Team - Construction Achievement**

Setup Screen:

• Shows Team Tower (Alex, Jordan, Sam, Taylor-returning characters from Lessons 1-2!)

• They've just completed the tallest, most stable tower the class has ever built

• Tower displayed prominently with all four team members standing proudly beside it

• Text: "Look who's here! It's Team Discovery from the beginning of our unit! They've been practicing teamwork and just accomplished something amazing. Let's see how celebration affects THEIR team..."

**EXPERIMENT A: Recognizing Only One Person's Contribution (20 seconds)**

Animation Sequence:

• Teacher approaches with camera to take photo of achievement

• Teacher: "Alex, stand in front of the tower! You're the leader-this is YOUR achievement! Say cheese!"

• Alex stands alone in front of tower for photo

• Jordan, Sam, and Taylor stand off to the side, not in photo

• Camera zooms to reactions:

Alex (in photo):

• Emotion indicator: Proud but uncomfortable

• Thought bubble: "But... we all built this together..."

• Body language: Smiling for camera but looking back at teammates

Jordan (not in photo):

• Emotion indicator: Hurt/excluded

• Thought bubble: "I organized all the materials..."

• Body language: Looking down, stepping further away

Sam (not in photo):

• Emotion indicator: Invisible/sad

• Thought bubble: "My design ideas aren't recognized..."

• Body language: Arms crossed, frowning

Taylor (not in photo):

• Emotion indicator: Unvalued

• Thought bubble: "I helped and encouraged everyone..."

• Body language: Turning away from group

Post-Celebration Effect:

• Team connection meter: 4/10 (LOW)

• Visual: Team members physically distancing from each other

• Text indicator: "Team feels divided-one person gets credit, three feel invisible"

**EXPERIMENT B: Celebrating Everyone's Contribution Equally (20 seconds)**

Same tower, same achievement, different celebration:

Animation Sequence:

• Teacher approaches with camera

• Teacher: "Team Discovery, gather around your tower! Alex, your leadership gave us direction. Jordan, your organization kept us prepared. Sam, your creative ideas made this design possible. Taylor, your support and encouragement kept everyone motivated. Everyone get in the photo-this is a TEAM achievement!"

• All four gather around tower together, hands touching the structure

• Photo taken with entire team

• Camera zooms to reactions:

Alex:

• Emotion indicator: Proud AND connected

• Thought bubble: "We did this together!"

• Body language: Arm around teammates

Jordan:

• Emotion indicator: Valued/appreciated

• Thought bubble: "My work was noticed!"

• Body language: Smiling, pointing to organized materials

Sam:

• Emotion indicator: Proud/belonging

• Thought bubble: "My ideas helped the team!"

• Body language: Gesturing to design features

Taylor:

• Emotion indicator: Essential/connected

• Thought bubble: "Supporting is just as important!"

• Body language: High-fiving everyone

Post-Celebration Effect:

• Team connection meter: 10/10 (HIGH)

• Visual: Team members close together, celebrating as one unit

• Text indicator: "Team feels unified-everyone's contribution valued equally"

Student Analysis Question: "Team Discovery worked together throughout this whole unit. What happens when only ONE person gets recognized for the team's achievement?"

Student Interaction:

• Click Button 1: "The recognized person feels great, and that's all that matters"

• Click Button 2: "The other three team members feel invisible and undervalued, weakening the team"

• Click Button 3: "It doesn't affect the team at all"

• Click Button 4: "It makes everyone work harder next time"

Correct Answer: Button 2

System Feedback: "You observed the effect of exclusive recognition! When only Alex got recognized, three team members felt their contributions didn't matter-even though Jordan organized, Sam created, and Taylor supported. This WEAKENED the team because three-quarters of the team felt invisible. In Experiment B, when EVERYONE's specific contributions were named, all four felt valued and connected. Celebrating one person might make that person happy, but celebrating the TEAM makes the entire team stronger and more motivated to cooperate again."

Follow-up Question: "Think back to Lessons 1, 2, and 3 where we learned about teamwork. What have Alex, Jordan, Sam, and Taylor learned throughout this unit?"

Student Interaction:

• Click Button 1: "That teamwork means combining efforts (Lesson 1)"

• Click Button 2: "That teams need different roles and listening skills (Lesson 2)"

• Click Button 3: "That teams solve problems together through challenges (Lesson 3)"

• Click Button 4: "That celebrating together makes all that teamwork feel rewarding (Lesson 4)"

• Click Button 5: "ALL of these lessons together"

Correct Answer: Button 5

System Feedback: "You've traced the complete teamwork journey! Team Discovery learned: (1) Teamwork combines efforts to achieve shared goals. (2) Strong teams have different valuable roles and use listening to coordinate. (3) Challenges are normal-teams solve problems cooperatively. (4) Celebrating together makes all that effort feel rewarding and meaningful. THIS is why celebration matters-it completes the cycle! When teams celebrate collective achievements, they feel proud of working together, which motivates them to be teams again. Celebration is what makes the whole teamwork cycle rewarding!"

**STATION 4: The Problem-Solver Team - Overcoming Challenge Achievement**

Setup Screen:

• Shows Team Resilience (four new cartoon characters) who just fixed a broken community playground together

• Team faced many setbacks and problems but persevered together

• Before/After photos of playground: broken → beautifully repaired

• Text: "Team Resilience faced a tough challenge-fixing a broken playground. They made mistakes, had disagreements, but solved every problem together. Now let's see how celebration affects teams who overcame difficulties..."

**EXPERIMENT A: Celebrating Only the Final Result (20 seconds)**

Animation Sequence:

• Community leader approaches team at repaired playground

• Leader: "The playground looks perfect! Thank you for the final result!"

• Takes photo of only the FINISHED playground (team not in photo)

• No mention of the challenges, mistakes, or problem-solving

• No mention of how they worked through difficulties

• Camera zooms to team reactions:

Team members' thoughts visible:

• "But... we worked so hard through all those problems..."

• "The mistakes we fixed together-that was the hardest part..."

• "We learned so much from the challenges..."

• "Our problem-solving-that's what we're proud of..."

Emotional indicators:

• Proud of result but feeling incomplete

• The journey isn't acknowledged

• Hard work through difficulties not recognized

Post-Celebration Survey:

• Question: "What are you proud of?"

• Results: "The playground looks nice, but... we wish someone noticed how we WORKED THROUGH the challenges together. That's what made us a strong team."

• Team connection meter: 6/10 (MEDIUM-proud of result but process not valued)

**EXPERIMENT B: Celebrating the EFFORT, GROWTH, and TEAMWORK Through Challenges (25 seconds)**

Same achievement, different celebration:

Animation Sequence:

• Community leader approaches team

• Leader: "We watched you work on this playground, and we're so impressed! You made mistakes-and fixed them together. You disagreed about approaches-and found compromises. You faced setbacks-and kept going as a team. The playground looks beautiful, but what we're REALLY celebrating is how you worked through every challenge together. Your problem-solving, your teamwork, your resilience-THAT'S what makes this achievement special!"

• Shows photo montage: team problem-solving, team discussing solutions, team supporting each other, team celebrating fixing mistakes

• Takes photo of team WITH the playground, emphasizing the people who made it happen

• Camera zooms to reactions:

Team members' emotions:

• Deeply moved and valued

• Feeling understood

• Proud not just of result but of the PROCESS

• Connected as a team who grew together

Team members' thoughts:

• "They noticed how hard we worked together!"

• "Our mistakes and problem-solving mattered!"

• "The challenges we faced made us stronger!"

• "This is what teamwork really means!"

Post-Celebration Survey:

• Question: "What are you proud of?"

• Results: "We're proud we WORKED THROUGH challenges as a team. The playground is beautiful, but our teamwork through difficulties-that's what we'll remember. That's what makes us want to take on hard challenges together again!"

• Team connection meter: 10/10 (HIGH-the journey and growth are valued)

Student Analysis Question: "Both experiments celebrated the same fixed playground. Why did Experiment B create deeper team pride and connection?"

Student Interaction:

• Click Button 1: "The playground looked better in Experiment B"

• Click Button 2: "Experiment B celebrated the EFFORT, GROWTH, and PROBLEM-SOLVING-not just the final result"

• Click Button 3: "The team worked harder in Experiment B"

• Click Button 4: "Experiment B gave them a bigger prize"

Correct Answer: Button 2

System Feedback: "You discovered a powerful truth about celebration! Experiment A only celebrated the finished playground-the RESULT. But the team's real achievement was working through mistakes, disagreements, and setbacks TOGETHER. Experiment B celebrated the EFFORT and GROWTH-how they solved problems, supported each other, and persevered as a team. When we celebrate the PROCESS and TEAMWORK (not just results), we make teams feel understood and valued for the hardest parts of cooperation. This makes teams MORE willing to face difficult challenges together in the future because they know their effort will be recognized and appreciated."

Follow-up Question: "Why is celebrating EFFORT and GROWTH more important than celebrating 'being perfect' or 'never making mistakes'?"

Student Interaction:

• Click Button 1: "Because all teams make mistakes-celebrating effort helps teams learn and improve"

• Click Button 2: "Because celebrating only perfection makes teams afraid to try hard things"

• Click Button 3: "Because growth and effort show teamwork skills, which are what matter"

• Click Button 4: "All of these reasons"

Correct Answer: Button 4

System Feedback: "You discovered why celebrating effort and growth builds resilient teams! When we celebrate effort: (1) Teams aren't afraid of mistakes-they know trying hard and learning are valued. (2) Teams take on challenging projects because the EFFORT will be appreciated, not just perfect results. (3) Teams build actual skills (problem-solving, perseverance, cooperation) rather than just seeking 'perfect outcomes.' Celebrating effort and growth makes teamwork about LEARNING and IMPROVING together, which creates teams that get stronger over time!"

**FINAL ROUND: Synthesis & Personal Application**

Setup Screen:

• Shows all four celebration stations visible on screen

• Text: "You've observed four teams and eight different celebration approaches. Now let's discover the patterns in what makes celebration strengthen teams!"

Synthesis Questions:

Question 1: "Look at all the celebrations that made teams feel MOST connected and motivated (all the Experiment B approaches). What do they have in common?"

Student Interaction:

• Click Button 1: "They recognized EVERYONE's contributions"

• Click Button 2: "They celebrated TEAMWORK and COOPERATION, not just winning or results"

• Click Button 3: "They celebrated EFFORT and GROWTH, not just being perfect"

• Click Button 4: "All of these celebration principles"

Correct Answer: Button 4

System Feedback: "You discovered the celebration principles that strengthen teams! Across all four stations, the strongest team connections came from celebrations that: (1) Recognized everyone's contributions equally. (2) Celebrated cooperation and teamwork itself, not just winning or 'being best.' (3) Celebrated effort, growth, and overcoming challenges, not just perfect results. These celebration types make ALL team members feel valued, make COOPERATION feel rewarding, and make teams willing to face FUTURE challenges together. That's how celebration builds lasting team spirit!"

Question 2: "Why do these celebration types create loops in team members' three mind parts?"

Student Interaction:

• Click Button 1: "Team celebrates everyone's contributions (Action Player: what team does) → Each Messenger feels valued → Each Idea Factory thinks 'I belong and matter' → Each Action Player wants to contribute again → Positive loop!"

• Click Button 2: "Celebration doesn't affect the three mind parts"

• Click Button 3: "Only winning creates loops in the mind parts"

Correct Answer: Button 1

System Feedback: "You understand the celebration loop! When teams celebrate COLLECTIVELY and recognize EVERYONE: Each team member's Messenger feels valued and connected → Their Idea Factory thinks 'I'm a meaningful part of this team' → Their Action Player becomes motivated to work with the team again → Creates positive loops that make future cooperation feel rewarding! Celebration isn't just a nice thing to do-it literally creates psychological loops that strengthen teams and make cooperation sustainable. That's the POWER of how we celebrate!"

Question 3: "Imagine YOUR class just worked together on a big project. Which celebration would make everyone want to work together again?"

Student Interaction:

• Click Button 1: "The teacher says: 'Maria did the best work! She's the star!'"

• Click Button 2: "The teacher says: 'We finished! Now let's move on.'"

• Click Button 3: "The teacher says: 'Look what WE achieved together! Sarah researched, Tom organized, Maya created, Leo supported-everyone contributed! I'm proud of how you worked as a TEAM!'"

• Click Button 4: "The teacher says: 'We beat the other class! We're #1!'"

Correct Answer: Button 3

System Feedback: "You know how to celebrate to strengthen teams! Option 3 recognizes EVERYONE's specific contributions and celebrates the TEAMWORK. This makes all team members feel valued, makes cooperation feel rewarding, and creates motivation to work together again. Option 1 makes most people feel invisible. Option 2 doesn't acknowledge the effort at all. Option 4 focuses on competition rather than cooperation. Option 3 is collective celebration that builds team spirit!"

Question 4: "Think about YOUR three mind parts throughout this whole teamwork unit (all 4 lessons). What changed from Lesson 1 to now?"

Student Interaction:

• Click Button 1: "My Idea Factory learned what teamwork is, how it works, and how to solve problems together"

• Click Button 2: "My Messenger experienced feeling capable, connected, and valued as a team member"

• Click Button 3: "My Action Player practiced teamwork skills: coordinating, listening, problem-solving, and celebrating"

• Click Button 4: "All three parts worked in loops to make me better at teamwork"

• Click Button 5: "ALL of these changes happened"

Correct Answer: Button 5

System Feedback: "You've traced your complete learning journey! Through this unit: Your Idea Factory learned teamwork concepts (combining efforts, roles, problem-solving, celebration). Your Messenger experienced teamwork feelings (capable, connected, valued, proud). Your Action Player practiced teamwork behaviors (coordinating, listening, compromising, celebrating). And these three parts worked in LOOPS-each time you DID teamwork, you FELT more capable, which made you THINK 'I can do this,' which made you DO more teamwork! This is how you grow at ANYTHING: Your three mind parts working together in loops through practice. You're now a skilled team member!"

Question 5: "One more question: Why does CELEBRATION complete the teamwork cycle?"

Student Interaction:

• Click Button 1: "Because celebration makes the hard work feel worth it"

• Click Button 2: "Because celebration makes team members feel their contributions mattered"

• Click Button 3: "Because celebration creates motivation to cooperate again in the future"

• Click Button 4: "All of these-celebration makes teamwork REWARDING and SUSTAINABLE"

Correct Answer: Button 4

System Feedback: "You discovered why celebration is essential to teamwork! Celebration completes the cycle: (1) Teams work hard together. (2) They overcome challenges. (3) They achieve something. (4) Celebration makes that effort feel REWARDING. (5) Feeling rewarded motivates them to be teams AGAIN. Without celebration-especially collective celebration that values everyone-teamwork can feel thankless and unsustainable. WITH celebration of collective effort, teamwork becomes something teams WANT to do, not just something they HAVE to do. That's why celebration matters-it makes cooperation rewarding and builds lasting team spirit!"

**Continuity Note**

Connection to Lesson Flow:

• Position in Lesson: Played after PRACTICE B (MindMaster Game - "Who Deserves Recognition?" scenario-based sorting)

• Reinforces: Students have just observed different recognition scenarios; this game extends that into deeper exploration of WHY celebration types matter and HOW they create lasting effects on team motivation and connection

• Returns to Familiar Characters: Alex, Jordan, Sam, and Taylor from Lessons 1-2 return at Station 3, providing emotional continuity and allowing students to see the complete journey from "What is teamwork?" to "Let's celebrate what we achieved together!"

Completes Unit Arc:

• Lesson 1: Established WHAT teamwork is (combining efforts toward shared goals that would be difficult alone)

• Lesson 2: Revealed HOW teamwork works mechanically (distributed roles + listening skills make coordination possible)

• Lesson 3: Showed WHEN teamwork matters most (during challenges-teams solve problems cooperatively, making them stronger)

• Lesson 4: Demonstrates WHY teamwork is sustainable (collective celebration makes cooperation feel rewarding, creating motivation to cooperate again)

The Complete Cycle:

1\. Teams form and combine efforts (Lesson 1)

2\. Teams coordinate through roles and listening (Lesson 2)

3\. Teams face and solve problems together (Lesson 3)

4\. Teams celebrate collective achievements (Lesson 4)

5\. Celebration creates motivation to form teams again → Cycle continues!

Connection to Psychology-as-Science Framework:

• Throughout all 4 lessons, students observed teamwork as a phenomenon with measurable effects

• They formed hypotheses (predictions about outcomes)

• They observed experiments (same situations, different variables, different results)

• They identified cause-and-effect relationships (certain team behaviors → certain outcomes)

• They traced psychological processes through the three mind parts (Idea Factory, Messenger, Action Player)

• They discovered loops (how actions change feelings, which change thoughts, which change actions again)

• Final lesson completes this by showing celebration as a VARIABLE that affects team sustainability

Bridge to Future Learning:

• Students finish Grade 1/2 with complete understanding of teamwork as both:

◦ An individual capability (I can be a valuable team member using skills I've learned)

◦ A collective process (Teams work through predictable patterns that can be understood scientifically)

• Prepares students for future curriculum that will build on these teamwork foundations

• Establishes that psychological and social processes can be studied, understood, and improved-building scientific thinking about human behavior

Emotional Arc of Unit:

• Lesson 1: Discovery and excitement ("Wow, teamwork really makes things possible!")

• Lesson 2: Skill-building and confidence ("I understand how teamwork works-I can do this!")

• Lesson 3: Challenge and resilience ("Problems are normal-I know how to solve them with my team!")

• Lesson 4: Pride and completion ("We achieved so much together-and celebrating makes me want to be part of teams again!")

Returns Full Circle:

• Unit began with students discovering teamwork exists and has effects

• Unit ends with students celebrating what they achieved by LEARNING ABOUT teamwork together (meta-moment: the class itself is a team that worked through this unit together!)

• Teacher can facilitate closing reflection: "We just learned about teamwork AS A TEAM. We combined our efforts (Lesson 1), we each had roles-some led discussions, some organized materials, some had creative ideas, some supported classmates (Lesson 2), we worked through confusing parts together (Lesson 3), and now we're celebrating what we learned together (Lesson 4). WE are a team!"
