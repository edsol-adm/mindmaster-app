# Lesson 1: Working Together Toward a Goal

---

## Lesson Objective
Students will understand that teamwork means combining efforts with others to achieve shared goals that would be difficult or impossible alone, and will recognize themselves as valuable team members who contribute to group success.

---

## Warm-Up (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *"One Person vs. Two People" Challenge*

Display a simple picture puzzle on the board or print one out (8–10 large pieces). Ask for one volunteer to assemble it alone while the class watches and times them silently. After that volunteer finishes (or after 2 minutes if they're struggling), ask for two more volunteers to assemble an identical puzzle together.

Discuss briefly:  
> "What did we notice? Was it faster with two people? Easier? Why do you think that happened?"  

Guide students to observe that two people could work on different parts at the same time, share ideas, and help each other.

Lead-in:  
> "Today we're learning about teamwork—what happens when people work together on purpose."

## Explore + Practice (30 minutes)

### Explore A: What Is Teamwork? (7 minutes)

**Activity:** *Video + Discussion (Media)*  

**Show the video:** “What is Teamwork?” by Crash Course Kids  
**Link:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc_h-YdN73I  
**Length:** ~2 minutes  

> **Note:** This video is *indicative only*. In the full MindMaster version, a copyright-free or custom video will be produced to illustrate the same teamwork concept.

**Discussion prompts:**  
After the video, ask:  
> "What examples did we see? Can you name a team? What were they trying to do together?"  

Introduce the key idea: Teamwork is when people combine their efforts, ideas, and skills to reach a goal they all care about. It's not just sitting near each other—it's working with a shared purpose.

### Practice A: Psychology Experiment – “Build It Alone vs. Build It Together” (8 minutes)

**Activity:** *In-Class Experiment (Hard Copy Materials)*

**Setup:** Divide the class into pairs. Prepare two sets of identical building materials (blocks, Lego, or large wooden pieces). One set stays in the middle of the room; the other is split between two corners.

**Steps (5-step experiment):**
1. **Condition A (Individual):** One child from each pair builds a simple tower alone using half the blocks (while their partner watches quietly). *Time: 3 minutes.*  
   *Note:* Do this with just 2–3 pairs as a demonstration while others observe.  
2. **Condition B (Team):** Now the same pairs work together with all the blocks to build a bigger tower. *Time: 3 minutes.*  
3. **Observation:** Ask the class:  
   > "What did you notice? Was the tower bigger? Did they finish faster? Did they help each other?"  
4. **Debrief:**  
   > "When we worked alone, we could only use our own hands and ideas. When we worked together, we had more hands, more ideas, and we could do something bigger. That's teamwork."  
5. **Record:** On a simple chart, write:  
   - "Alone = [size/outcome]"  
   - "Together = [bigger/faster/easier outcome]."  
   This becomes a visual reminder.

> **Teacher Note:** This works well with mixed ability—stronger builders can help younger ones, and everyone contributes to the larger outcome.

### Practice B: MindMaster Game – “Team vs. No Team” (10 minutes)

**Activity:** *Game (MindMaster App with Clicker Technology)*  

**Game Format:** Matching Pairs with Visual Sorting  

**Game Flow:**
- **Setup:** Students see pairs of images on the TV screen side by side. Each pair shows: (A) a "Team Goal" scenario and (B) a "Just Proximity" scenario. Students must click 1–4 to match which side shows "real teamwork."
- **Play (6 rounds):**  
  1. Left side = kids building a block tower together; Right side = kids sitting at separate desks. Click 1 (left) or 2 (right) for real teamwork.  
  2. Left = kids passing a ball in a circle game; Right = kids sitting near each other not talking. Click 1 or 2?  
  3. Left = kids rehearsing a play together; Right = kids waiting in a line. Click 1 or 2?  
  4. Left = kids making art individually at tables; Right = kids painting a mural together. Click 1 or 2?  
  5. Left = kids sitting near each other on the carpet; Right = kids planning a game together. Click 1 or 2?  
  6. Left = kids solving a puzzle together as a team; Right = kids doing independent reading near each other. Click 1 or 2?  
- **Scoring:** 1 point per correct identification. Group total displayed after each round.  
- **Win Condition:** Class celebrates when they correctly identify 5+ scenarios. Announce:  
  > "You understand the difference between teamwork and just being near each other!"

**Connection to Lesson:** This game reinforces the distinction between proximity and cooperation—a key learning outcome.

**Timing in Lesson:** Play after Practice A so students have concrete experience with teamwork before categorizing scenarios.

## Reflection (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *Turn and Talk (Peer Sharing)*  

**Prompt:**  
> "Think of a time you worked with someone to do something. It could be at home, at school, or anywhere. Turn to a partner and tell them: What were you trying to do together? Did working together make it easier, faster, or more fun?"  

As students share, listen for language that shows they recognize shared purpose and combined effort. Affirm examples:  
> "Yes, you were working together on a shared goal!"

---

## Home Prep (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *MindMaster Preview (Teacher Guidance)*  

> "Tonight, your family will use a special app on a screen called MindMaster. You'll see pictures and make choices by clicking a button. Just like in our game today, you'll be thinking about teamwork. You don't need to study—just have fun and notice which pictures show teamwork and which don't. Tomorrow we'll talk about what you learned!"

Hand out a simple printed reminder (or message to parents via app):  
> "Watch for teamwork tonight! Can you spot a team in a show you watch, or a team in your home doing something together?"

## Connection to Unit Arc

Lesson 1 → Lesson 2: This lesson establishes that teamwork is a real thing with real benefits. Lesson 2 will zoom in on the skills that make teamwork work—listening, turn-taking, and sharing roles. Students will now see those skills as the "ingredients" that create the teamwork they've just experienced.
