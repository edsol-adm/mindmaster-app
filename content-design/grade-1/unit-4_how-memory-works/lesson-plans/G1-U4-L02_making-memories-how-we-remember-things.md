# Lesson 2: Making Memories – How We Remember Things

## Lesson Objective
Students will understand the three stages of memory (noticing/encoding, storing, retrieving) and learn that paying attention is the first critical step in forming strong memories.

---

## Connection to Unit Arc
Lesson 1 established what memory is. Lesson 2 reveals how memory works—the mechanism. By understanding these three stages, students build the foundation for Lesson 3, where they learn they can strengthen memory through intentional strategies. Lesson 4 then explains why memories sometimes differ or fade (the limits of the process).

## Warm-Up (5 minutes)

**Activity: "Noticed vs. Ignored"**

Show the class a busy image on screen for 10 seconds, then remove it. Ask:  
“Quick—what did you see?”  
Take a few answers. Then ask: “Why did you remember that and not something else? What did you notice?”

Introduce:  
“Today, we're going to explore the three secret steps your brain takes to make a memory: first, you notice something; second, your brain stores it; third, you can bring it back. Let's see how it works.”

**Pedagogy note:** The warm-up shows that attention is the entry point to memory—an observation students can make immediately.

## Explore + Practice (30 minutes)

### Explore A: The Three Stages of Memory (7 minutes)
**Materials:** Hard copy – poster or large drawing showing three boxes labeled “NOTICE → STORE → RETRIEVE”

Draw or display three connected boxes on a chart. Walk through each stage using a concrete example:

- **Stage 1 – NOTICE (Encoding):** “When your teacher tells you a story, the first thing that happens is you listen. Your attention is on the story. You're noticing details—the character's name, what they did, how it ended.”  
- **Stage 2 – STORE (Storage):** “Your brain then keeps that information safe inside, like putting it in a treasure box. It stays there, even when you're not thinking about it.”  
- **Stage 3 – RETRIEVE (Retrieval):** “Later, when your teacher asks, ‘Do you remember the story?’ your brain goes back to the treasure box and brings the information back. You remember it!”

Display the poster and leave it visible throughout the lesson. This is the conceptual spine of Lesson 2.

**Pedagogy note:** The three-stage model is the information-processing framework, simplified and made concrete. Students need to internalize this sequence.

### Practice A: Psychology Experiment – "Focused vs. Distracted" (8 minutes)
**Experiment Format:** In-class Comparison Test (no MindMaster)

This experiment directly shows students that attention (Stage 1: Notice) determines how well memory works (Stage 3: Retrieve).

**Setup:**
- Prepare two scenarios: one focused, one distracted.  
- **Scenario A (Focused):** Read a short 5-sentence story to students. Ask them to listen carefully. No interruptions. Then ask them to write or draw what they remember.  
- **Scenario B (Distracted):** Read a different 5-sentence story. While reading, ring a bell randomly, flash lights, or ask silly questions. Then ask them to write or draw what they remember.

**Steps:**
1. **Scenario A – Focused:** Read story clearly; students listen with no distractions. “Pay attention—your job is to notice and remember.”  
2. **Scenario B – Distracted:** Read a different story; introduce distractions. “Listen, but things might be distracting—see what happens.”  
3. Collect responses from both scenarios (drawings or writing).  
4. Compare: Lay out responses side by side. “Which story did everyone remember better? Why? Because you noticed more when you were focused.”  
5. Debrief: “Attention is the first step. When you notice carefully, your brain stores more, and later you can bring back more. Distraction makes noticing harder, so memory is weaker.”

**Pedagogy note:** This hands-on experiment lets students see the causal link between attention and memory. It’s not abstract—they experience it.

### Psychology Video (2 minutes)

**Video:** "The Magic of Memory" by National Geographic Kids  
**Link:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKk0Dqf46Jc  

**Note:** This video is indicative only. In the full MindMaster version, a modified or copyright-free video will be produced or featured to illustrate the same concept.

**Purpose:** Shows memory in action in animal and human brains, reinforcing that memory is a universal biological process. The visuals of “capturing” and “storing” support the three-stage model.  
**Timing:** Play after Explore A to extend understanding with real-world examples.

### Practice B: MindMaster In-Class Quiz (7 minutes)

**Quiz Format:** True/False Quick Fire  
**Quiz Title:** "Memory Stages – True or False?"

**Quiz Flow:**
- **Number of Questions:** 5  
- **Presentation Style:** Each statement appears on screen, spoken aloud by teacher. Students see two large buttons: ✅ (TRUE) or ❌ (FALSE). Teacher reads: “When you notice something carefully, your memory stores more of it. True or false?”  
- **Clicker Response:** Students use buttons 1 (TRUE) or 2 (FALSE).  
- **Feedback:** After each answer, teacher reveals correct answer with brief explanation. E.g., “True! Noticing is the first step. What you notice, you store.”  
- **Scoring:** 1 point per correct answer. Running total shown on screen.  
- **Win Condition:** 5/5 correct = “Memory Scientist!” celebration.

**Sample Questions:**
1. "Memory has three stages: notice, store, and bring back." (True)  
2. "If you are distracted, your brain notices more." (False)  
3. "Retrieval means bringing information back from memory." (True)  
4. "Everyone notices the same things, so everyone remembers exactly the same." (False)  
5. "Paying attention is the first step in making a memory." (True)  

**Stage in Lesson:** After Psychology Experiment. Consolidates understanding of the three-stage model.

## Reflection (5 minutes)

**Activity:** "I Can Notice" (Hard Copy + Discussion)

Hand out simple reflection cards with sentence starters:
- “When I notice carefully, I can remember …”  
- “Something that helps me notice is …”  
- “One thing I noticed today was …”

Students complete 1–2 starters. Invite 3–4 volunteers to share.  
**Teacher affirms:** “You're all noticing scientists. The more you notice, the more you can remember.”

---

## Home Prep (5 minutes)

**Teacher Guidance for At-Home MindMaster Use**

Explain:  
“Tonight, you'll play a game on MindMaster that practices all three memory stages. At home, try this: play the game while your family watches. After you play, tell them the three stages: notice, store, retrieve. You're teaching them how memory works!”

Send home a simple card:
> **The Three Stages:** NOTICE (pay attention) → STORE (keep it safe) → RETRIEVE (bring it back).  
> **Your task:** Find one moment today where you noticed something carefully. Did you remember it better?

## Digital Outputs for Lesson 2

### Psychology Video
**Title:** The Magic of Memory  
**Link:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKk0Dqf46Jc  
**Duration:** ~2 minutes  
**Note:** This video is indicative only. In the full MindMaster version, a modified or copyright-free video will be produced or featured to illustrate the same concept.  
**Why this video:** Shows memory operating across different species and brains, emphasizing it as a universal biological function. Visuals align with encoding/storage/retrieval concepts.

### Psychology Experiment
**Name:** "Focused vs. Distracted"  
**Format:** In-class Comparison Test (no MindMaster)  

**Steps:**
- Read a 5-sentence story to focused students with no distractions.  
- Read a different 5-sentence story with deliberate distractions (bells, questions, etc.).  
- Ask students to draw/write what they remember from each story.  
- Compare responses side by side.  
- Debrief: Notice (attention) determines how much memory stores.

### In-Class Game (MindMaster)
**Game Format:** Sequence Builder  
**Title:** "Build the Memory Process"

**Game Flow:**
- **Setup:** Three images appear randomly on screen: a girl listening to a story (NOTICE), a brain icon with gears (STORE), a girl recalling the story (RETRIEVE). Students must arrange them in correct order.  
- **Play:** Students use clickers (buttons 1–3) to select which image represents Stage 1, Stage 2, Stage 3. After each selection, feedback confirms or guides correction.  
- **Scoring:** 1 point per correct stage placement (3 points max).  
- **Win Condition:** All three stages in correct order. Teacher celebrates: “You understand how memory works!”  
- **Stage in Lesson:** Mid-practice, after Explore A. Cements the three-stage sequence before the experiment validates it.
