## In-Class-Game 4A – Memory Sorting Station

## Lesson 1: Memory - Our Mind's Storage Box

**Learning Objectives:**

- Define memory as the mind's tool for storing information and bringing it back when needed
- Identify at least four types of information memory stores (e.g., names, experiences, skills, facts)
- Explain that memory is not mysterious-it's a function of the mind that can be observed and understood
- Describe how memory helps in daily life using personal examples
- Recognize that while everyone has memory, people may remember different things or in different ways

**GAME FILE NAME: icg-04.01-game01.html**

**GAME TITLE:** Memory Sorting Station

**GAME FORMAT:** Categorize by Sequence (First → Next → Last) - adapted as "Sort into Categories"

**Format Justification:** This format has only 1 prior use and is pedagogically ideal for Lesson 1's objective of identifying different types of information memory stores. Students actively classify examples into memory categories (names, experiences, skills, facts), directly reinforcing the core concept that memory stores multiple kinds of information. The sorting mechanic makes abstract categories concrete and observable, aligning with the psychology-as-science framework.

**Format Status:** Available (1 use in Round 1)

**PURPOSE:** Students discover that memory stores different types of information by actively sorting examples into four categories: Names & Faces, Skills & Actions, Stories & Experiences, and Facts & Knowledge. This reinforces memory as an observable, classifiable mental function rather than something mysterious.

**LESSON ARC LOCATION :** 16-26 minutes into the 45-minute lesson. AFTER (16-20M) Explore A discussion where students co-create a chart showing different types of information memory stores. IN-CLASS GAME - "Memory's Sorting Station". BEFORE (29-40M) Reflection activity where students identify what their own memory stores.

**Pedagogical Justification:** Game placed mid-lesson as guided practice after conceptual introduction. Students have just discussed and charted memory categories with the teacher. The game provides immediate hands-on reinforcement by having students independently classify examples, testing their understanding of WHAT memory stores. This active sorting transforms abstract categories into concrete, observable choices. Post-game discussion allows teacher to consolidate understanding and address misconceptions before the reflection activity.

**CONTINUITY NOTE**

**Link to Prior/Future Lessons:**

**Foundation for Unit:** This is Lesson 1 - the foundational lesson of Unit 4. Students have not yet learned HOW memory works or how to strengthen it. This game establishes WHAT memory does (stores different types of information) and makes memory concrete and observable.

**Connection to Lesson 2:** Next lesson will build on this by exploring HOW memories are made (notice → store → retrieve). Students will understand that these four categories of information all go through the same three-stage process.

**Connection to Lesson 3:** Future lesson will teach strategies to strengthen memory. Students will apply those strategies to all four categories learned today.

**Connection to Lesson 4:** Final lesson will explain why people remember different things. Today's game shows WHAT is stored; Lesson 4 will explain that what gets stored depends on what each person noticed.

**Psychology-as-Science Thread:** This game models classification - a core scientific skill. Students observe examples, identify patterns, and sort into categories based on observable features. This mirrors how psychologists classify types of memory in actual memory research.

**ESTIMATED PLAY TIME**

**Total Duration:** 10 minutes

**Time Breakdown:**

- **Setup/Introduction:** 1 minute (opening screen, Dr. Memory intro, instructions)
- **12 Sorting Challenges:** 7 minutes
  - Each challenge: ~30-35 seconds (15 sec presentation + 10 sec response collection + 10 sec feedback)

**ALIGNMENT WITH PSYCHOLOGY-AS-SCIENCE FRAMEWORK**

**Observable Phenomena**

Students observe that memory stores different, classifiable types of information - this makes memory concrete rather than mysterious.

**Classification Science**

The game models scientific classification: observing examples, identifying features, grouping by shared characteristics. This mirrors how psychologists classify memory types.

**Neutral Descriptive Feedback**

Feedback explains WHY an answer is correct using factual language ("This is a skill because...") rather than praise ("Great job!").

**Avoids Therapy/SEL Framing**

- No emotional management or coping skills
- No personalized feelings exploration
- Focus is on memory as a cognitive function, not on the child's emotional state

**Builds Self-Efficacy Through Knowledge**

**Students learn "I can identify what memory stores" - empowerment comes from understanding how the mind works, not from external validation.**

## In-Class-Game 4B – The Memory Machine

## Lesson 2: Making Memories - How We Remember Things

**Learning Objectives:**

- Describe the three stages of memory: noticing/encoding, storing, and retrieving, using simple language or examples
- Explain that paying attention is the first step in forming strong memories (e.g., "What I notice carefully gets stored")
- Demonstrate through comparison how attention affects memory by recalling more details from a focused activity than a distracted one
- Recognize that distraction during noticing makes later remembering harder
- Apply the understanding that they can help their memory by focusing carefully on what they want to remember

**GAME FILE NAME: icg-04.02-game01.html**

**GAME TITLE:** The Memory Machine

**GAME FORMAT:** Hypothesis Tester

**Format Justification:** This format has 0 prior uses and is pedagogically ideal for Lesson 2's objective of demonstrating how attention affects memory formation. Students predict outcomes (hypothesis) before testing them through memory challenges, then observe results to confirm or revise their understanding. This scientific prediction-and-test approach makes the three-stage memory process (notice → store → retrieve) observable and testable, directly aligning with teaching psychology as science. The format emphasizes cause-effect reasoning: strong attention → strong memory; weak attention → weak memory.

**Format Status:** Available (0 uses in Round 1)

**PURPOSE:** Students discover the three-stage memory process (noticing/encoding, storing, retrieving) by predicting and testing how different attention levels affect memory strength. They observe firsthand that what they notice carefully gets stored better, making the information-processing model concrete and testable.

**LESSON ARC LOCATION :** 16-26 minutes into the 45-minute lesson. AFTER (16-20M) Discuss how attention affects memory formation. IN-CLASS GAME - "The Memory Machine". BEFORE Reflection - students discuss observations about attention and memory.

**Pedagogical Justification:** Game serves as experiential observation after direct instruction. Students have just learned the three-stage model (notice → store → retrieve) and that attention strengthens encoding. The game transforms this abstract model into testable predictions across 12 scenarios. By predicting outcomes before testing, students engage in scientific reasoning: forming hypotheses about how attention level will affect recall, then observing results that confirm the model. This active hypothesis-testing makes cause-effect relationships visible and builds deeper understanding than passive observation alone.

**Dr. Memory Prompt:** "Make your prediction! Use what you know about NOTICING."

**Visual Aid (sidebar):** Small reminder diagram showing:

- "FOCUSED ATTENTION → STRONG MEMORY"
- "DISTRACTED ATTENTION → WEAK MEMORY"

**Student Action:** Each student uses clicker to press Button 1 or Button 2

**Response Collection Visual:**

- Buttons pulse gently as votes come in
- Counter shows: "Predictions received: 18/20"
- No individual results shown yet (maintains suspense)

**PHASE 3: CLASS PREDICTION SUMMARY (5 seconds)**

**Screen Update:**

- Scenario card shrinks to top corner
- **Center Display:** Bar chart appears showing class predictions

**"Our Class Predicts:" Header**

**Bar Chart Display:**

- **Green bar (left):** "Strong Memory: \[X\] students" - shows number who pressed Button 1
- **Orange bar (right):** "Weak Memory: \[Y\] students" - shows number who pressed Button 2
- Bars animate growing from zero to final count

**Dr. Memory:** "Interesting! Let's test it and see what actually happens..."

**Visual:** Memory Machine in background begins glowing brighter, gears spin faster (building anticipation)

**PHASE 4: MEMORY TEST ANIMATION (10 seconds)**

**Screen Shows Memory Machine in Action:**

**Stage 1 - NOTICE:**

- Left funnel of machine lights up
- Animation shows the scenario input entering the "NOTICE" stage
- **If focused attention:** Bright, clear items flow smoothly into funnel with sparkles
- **If distracted attention:** Dim, faded items flow in with gaps/holes visible

**Stage 2 - STORE:**

- Middle chamber lights up
- **If focused:** Items are wrapped and stored neatly in glowing treasure box
- **If distracted:** Items are stored loosely, some fade away or fall through gaps

**Stage 3 - RETRIEVE:**

- Right output lights up
- Treasure box opens
- **If focused:** Items flow out clearly, complete and bright
- **If distracted:** Few items come out, they're dim or incomplete

**Narration Text (appears during animation):**

- Stage 1: "Maya was DISTRACTED while noticing..."
- Stage 2: "So the name was stored WEAKLY..."
- Stage 3: "When she tries to retrieve it..."

**PHASE 5: RESULT REVEAL & FEEDBACK (15 seconds)**

**Screen Update:**

- Memory Machine test completes
- **Large Result Banner appears (center):**

**Result Display:**

- **If WEAK MEMORY result:**
  - Banner color: Orange
  - Text: "WEAK MEMORY - Maya forgot the name!"
  - Icon: Dim/empty treasure box
- **If STRONG MEMORY result:**
  - Banner color: Green
  - Text: "STRONG MEMORY - Maya remembered the name!"
  - Icon: Bright/full treasure box

**Correct Prediction Highlight:**

- The button students should have chosen (Button 1 or 2) is highlighted with a gold border and checkmark
- **If student predicted correctly:** Their clicker vibrates gently or shows green light
- **If student predicted incorrectly:** Their clicker shows orange light (neutral, not "wrong")

**Dr. Memory Explanation (speech bubble):** Provides brief scientific explanation connecting attention to result:

- **Example (distracted scenario):** "Maya was DISTRACTED, so her mind didn't notice the name clearly. What you don't notice carefully doesn't get stored well. That's why her memory was WEAK."
- **Example (focused scenario):** "Jin was FOCUSED, so his mind noticed all the details. What you notice carefully gets stored strongly. That's why his memory was STRONG."

**Class Results Display:**

- Small scoreboard appears showing: "Students who predicted correctly: \[X\]/20"
- Brief positive acknowledgment: "Many of us are learning how attention affects memory!"

**Key Science Concept Highlight (appears in text box):**

- **After distracted scenarios:** "DISTRACTION during noticing → WEAK storing → WEAK retrieving"
- **After focused scenarios:** "ATTENTION during noticing → STRONG storing → STRONG retrieving"

**Audio:**

- **Correct prediction:** Gentle success chime
- **Incorrect prediction:** Neutral "learning" sound (soft bell, not negative)

**PHASE 6: SCORE UPDATE & TRANSITION (5 seconds)**

**Scoring Update:**

- **Individual:** Each student's clicker displays their updated score (number of correct predictions: 0-12)
- **Class:** Main screen updates "Predictions Correct: \[X\]/12"

**Hypothesis Badge Progress:**

- Badge outline at bottom gradually fills with color as students make correct predictions
- Visual encouragement of scientific thinking growth

**Audio:** Upbeat, triumphant music (10 seconds)

**CONTINUITY NOTE**

**Link to Prior/Future Lessons:**

**Connection to Lesson 1:** Builds directly on Lesson 1's foundation. Students learned WHAT memory stores (names, skills, stories, facts). Today they learn HOW those things get stored-through the three-stage process. The same Dr. Memory character provides continuity.

**Foundation for Lesson 3:** Next lesson will teach specific strategies to strengthen memory (repetition, association, storytelling, visualization). Today's game establishes that attention is foundational-those strategies won't work without noticing first. Students now understand the mechanism they'll be optimizing.

**Connection to Lesson 4:** Final lesson will explain why memories differ and why forgetting happens. Today's game shows that weak attention = weak storage, setting up the understanding that different people notice different things (Lesson 4's core concept).

**Psychology-as-Science Thread:** This game models hypothesis testing-core scientific method. Students make predictions based on a model (attention affects memory), test those predictions through observation, and confirm or revise understanding based on results. This mirrors how psychologists conduct memory experiments.

**Unit Arc:**

- Lesson 1: WHAT memory does (stores information)
- **Lesson 2: HOW memory works (three-stage process)** ← Current game
- Lesson 3: How to STRENGTHEN memory (strategies)

## In-Class-Game 4C – Memory Power-Ups

## Lesson 3: Strengthening Memory - Tricks Our Mind Uses

**Learning Objectives:**

- Identify at least three memory strategies: repetition, association, storytelling, and visualization
- Apply one memory strategy to successfully remember a short list or sequence (e.g., creating a silly story to link items)
- Explain how each strategy helps memory work better (e.g., "Repetition gives my mind more chances to store it")
- Demonstrate the ability to choose an appropriate memory strategy for a given task
- Recognize that memory can be strengthened with practice and intentional strategies, building self-efficacy ("I can help my memory work better")

**GAME FILE NAME: icg-04.03-game01.html**

**GAME TITLE:** Memory Power-Ups

**GAME FORMAT**

**Format:** Balance Tester

**Format Justification:** This format has only 1 prior use and is pedagogically ideal for Lesson 3's objective of testing and comparing memory strategies. Students adjust variables (which strategy to use) and observe outcomes (how well memory performs), discovering through experimentation which strategies work best for different memory tasks. The balance mechanic represents finding the "right fit" between task and strategy-demonstrating that memory improvement comes from selecting appropriate tools, not random effort. This hands-on experimentation makes self-efficacy concrete: students actively control memory outcomes through strategic choices, proving "I can strengthen my memory."

**Format Status:** Available (1 use in Round 1)

**PURPOSE**

Students discover that memory can be actively strengthened by testing four memory strategies (repetition, association, storytelling, visualization) across different challenges. They experiment with strategy selection, observe which strategies work best for different tasks, and build self-efficacy through successful application: "I can help my memory work better by choosing the right strategy."

**LESSON ARC LOCATION:** 11-21 minutes into the 45-minute lesson. AFTER (11-15M) Demonstration of one strategy (e.g., repetition with class example). IN-CLASS GAME - "Strategy Lab: Memory Power-Ups". BEFORE (26-40M) Post-game sharing - students discuss which strategies worked best, when to use each.

**Pedagogical Justification:** Game functions as direct strategy application after brief introduction. Rather than extended teacher demonstration of all four strategies, students actively test each strategy through the game's experimental challenges. This discovery-based approach builds self-efficacy through personal experience of strategy effectiveness. By testing strategies in varied contexts (lists, sequences, facts, skills), students learn strategic selection-matching the right tool to the task-rather than memorizing rules. The balance mechanic makes abstract concepts (strategy effectiveness) concrete and observable.

**Response Collection Visual:**

- Strategy buttons glow as votes come in
- Counter shows: "Scientists choosing: 17/20"
- No results shown yet (maintains experimental suspense)

**PHASE 3: CLASS STRATEGY DISTRIBUTION (5 seconds)**

**Screen Update:**

- **"Our Lab's Strategy Choices:" header appears**
- **Bar chart displays class selections:**
  - Bar 1 (blue): "Repetition: \[X\] scientists"
  - Bar 2 (green): "Association: \[Y\] scientists"
  - Bar 3 (orange): "Storytelling: \[Z\] scientists"
  - Bar 4 (purple): "Visualization: \[W\] scientists"

**Professor Power-Up:** "Interesting choices! Let's test what happens when we use each strategy..."

**Visual:** Balance scale begins to tilt as if weighing the strategies

**PHASE 4: STRATEGY TESTING ANIMATION (15 seconds)**

**The game tests ALL FOUR strategies to show comparative effectiveness**

**Animation Sequence:** The balance scale tests each strategy one at a time, showing memory strength results for each.

**For Each Strategy (4 quick tests, ~3 seconds each):**

- **Strategy icon appears on right platform**
- **Animation shows the strategy being applied:**
  - **Repetition:** Items flash/repeat 3 times quickly
  - **Association:** Items connect to familiar objects with linking animation
  - **Storytelling:** Items arrange into a sequential narrative path with arrows
  - **Visualization:** Items transform into vivid mental pictures with color enhancement
- **Memory Strength Meter responds:**
  - Pointer moves up (strong match) or stays low (weak match)
  - Meter fills with color: green (strong), yellow (medium), red (weak)
- **Result recorded:** Small icon with strength rating appears next to that strategy

**Visual Display During Testing:**

- Four strategy icons line up horizontally
- Each gets a memory strength rating shown as vertical bar height
- Comparative view: students can SEE which strategy produced strongest result

**Example Visual Result (for "Remember 5 grocery items"):**

- Repetition: ★★ (medium - yellow bar, 40% height)
- Association: ★★ (medium - yellow bar, 50% height)
- Storytelling: ★★★★ (strong - green bar, 95% height) ← BEST FIT
- Visualization: ★★★ (good - yellow-green bar, 75% height)

**PHASE 5: OPTIMAL STRATEGY REVEAL & FEEDBACK (15 seconds)**

**Screen Update:**

- **Balance scale settles with optimal strategy glowing on right platform**
- **"BEST FIT STRATEGY" banner appears**

**Result Display:**

**Optimal Strategy Highlighted:**

- The most effective strategy for this challenge is enlarged and glows gold
- **Example:** For grocery list challenge, STORYTELLING button glows gold with ★★★★ rating
- Memory Strength Meter points to "STRONG" zone (green)

**Professor Power-Up Explanation (speech bubble):** Provides brief scientific reasoning for why this strategy works best for this task type:

**Example Explanations:**

- **Storytelling for lists:** "STORYTELLING worked best! When you turn items into a story, your brain links them together. Stories are easier to remember than separate items because they have a path."
- **Repetition for passwords:** "REPETITION worked best! Numbers don't connect to other ideas easily, so repeating them many times gives your brain more chances to store the pattern."
- **Association for new words:** "ASSOCIATION worked best! When you link a new word to something you already know, your memory has a hook to grab onto."
- **Visualization for descriptions:** "VISUALIZATION worked best! Creating a colorful mental picture makes details stick because your brain stores images strongly."

**Student Scoring:**

**Points Earned:**

- **If student chose the OPTIMAL strategy:**
  - +3 Lab Points
  - Message: "Perfect match! You chose the strongest strategy for this task!"
  - Visual: Gold star appears, beaker fills significantly
- **If student chose a GOOD strategy (2nd or 3rd best):**
  - +2 Lab Points
  - Message: "Good thinking! This strategy works, though \[optimal\] might be even stronger."
  - Visual: Silver star appears, beaker fills moderately
- **If student chose WEAKEST strategy:**
  - +1 Lab Point (participation)
  - Message: "You experimented! For this task, \[optimal\] might work better. Let's test more!"
  - Visual: Bronze star, beaker fills slightly

**Strategy Badge Progress:**

- Each time a student uses a strategy (regardless of whether optimal), that strategy's badge begins to fill
- Goal: Encourage students to try ALL strategies across the 8 trials
- Badge fills incrementally: use a strategy 2 times → badge complete → "Strategy Explorer!" for that strategy

**Key Learning Highlight (text box appears):** "WHAT WE DISCOVERED: \[Strategy name\] works well for \[task type\] because \[reason\]."

**Class Results:**

- Small display shows: "Scientists who found the best match: \[X\]/20"
- Encouraging message: "We're learning which strategies fit which tasks!"

**Audio:**

- **Optimal strategy chosen:** Success chime + sparkle sound
- **Good strategy chosen:** Gentle positive sound
- **Weak strategy chosen:** Neutral learning sound (not negative)

**PHASE 6: TRANSITION TO NEXT TRIAL (5 seconds)**

**Screen Reset:**

- Balance scale returns to neutral position
- Challenge card clears from left platform
- Strategy buttons reset (no selection)

**8 EXPERIMENTAL TRIALS (Complete Set with Optimal Strategies)**

**TRIAL 1: LIST MEMORY**

- **Challenge:** "Remember 5 grocery items: milk, eggs, bread, cheese, apples"
- **Task Type:** Multiple unrelated items
- **Optimal Strategy:** Storytelling (★★★★)
  - Rationale: Links separate items into coherent narrative path
- **Good Strategies:** Visualization (★★★), Association (★★)
- **Weak Strategy:** Repetition (★★) - works but less efficient for multiple items
- **Explanation:** "Storytelling worked best! When you turn items into a story like 'I drank MILK with my EGGS, then ate BREAD with CHEESE, then had APPLES,' your brain links them together."

**TRIAL 2: NUMBER SEQUENCE**

- **Challenge:** "Remember the password: 7-4-2-9"
- **Task Type:** Abstract number sequence
- **Optimal Strategy:** Repetition (★★★★)
  - Rationale: Abstract sequences need repeated encoding
- **Good Strategies:** Visualization (★★★) - could picture numbers, Association (★★) - could link to familiar numbers
- **Weak Strategy:** Storytelling (★) - hard to make story from numbers
- **Explanation:** "Repetition worked best! Numbers don't have meanings, so saying '7-4-2-9' many times gives your brain multiple chances to store the pattern."

**TRIAL 3: NEW VOCABULARY**

- **Challenge:** "Remember this new word: 'photosynthesis' means plants making food"
- **Task Type:** New term with definition
- **Optimal Strategy:** Association (★★★★)
  - Rationale: Linking new word to familiar concept
- **Good Strategies:** Visualization (★★★) - picture plants making food, Storytelling (★★)
- **Weak Strategy:** Repetition (★★) - helps pronunciation but not meaning
- **Explanation:** "Association worked best! You can link 'photo' (pictures/light) and 'synthesis' (making) to remember: plants use LIGHT to MAKE food."

**TRIAL 4: SEQUENCE ORDER**

- **Challenge:** "Remember the order: wake up → brush teeth → eat breakfast → go to school"
- **Task Type:** Sequential steps
- **Optimal Strategy:** Storytelling (★★★★)
  - Rationale: Natural narrative flow
- **Good Strategies:** Visualization (★★★) - picture each step, Repetition (★★)
- **Weak Strategy:** Association (★) - sequence needs flow, not isolated links
- **Explanation:** "Storytelling worked best! Your morning is already a story, so following the path from start to finish helps memory store the order."

**TRIAL 5: MULTIPLE FACTS**

- **Challenge:** "Remember these animal facts: Elephants have trunks. Lions have manes. Bears hibernate."
- **Task Type:** Multiple distinct facts
- **Optimal Strategy:** Visualization (★★★★)
  - Rationale: Creating vivid mental images for each
- **Good Strategies:** Storytelling (★★★) - could link animals, Association (★★★)
- **Weak Strategy:** Repetition (★★) - three separate facts hard to repeat
- **Explanation:** "Visualization worked best! When you picture a big TRUNK on an elephant, a golden MANE on a lion, and a bear SLEEPING in a cave, the images stick in memory."

**TRIAL 6: PHONE NUMBER**

- **Challenge:** "Remember your friend's new phone number: 555-1234"
- **Task Type:** Number sequence
- **Optimal Strategy:** Repetition (★★★★)
  - Rationale: Abstract numbers need encoding through repetition
- **Good Strategies:** Association (★★★) - if numbers have personal meaning, Visualization (★★)
- **Weak Strategy:** Storytelling (★) - difficult to narrate numbers
- **Explanation:** "Repetition worked best! Phone numbers are patterns without meaning, so saying '555-1234' over and over helps your brain store the sequence."

**TRIAL 7: CHARACTER NAME**

- **Challenge:** "Remember the character's name: The brave knight is named Sir Galahad"
- **Task Type:** Proper name with context
- **Optimal Strategy:** Association (★★★★)
  - Rationale: Linking name to character trait or familiar word
- **Good Strategies:** Visualization (★★★) - picture knight named Galahad, Storytelling (★★★)
- **Weak Strategy:** Repetition (★★) - name is unusual, needs meaning connection
- **Explanation:** "Association worked best! You can link 'Galahad' to 'gallant' (brave), or picture a knight with the name on his shield-connecting the name to something meaningful."

**TRIAL 8: SHAPE SEQUENCE**

- **Challenge:** "Remember these shapes in order: circle → square → triangle → star"
- **Task Type:** Visual sequence
- **Optimal Strategy:** Visualization (★★★★)
  - Rationale: Shapes are inherently visual
- **Good Strategies:** Storytelling (★★★) - create path through shapes, Repetition (★★)
- **Weak Strategy:** Association (★★) - shapes don't naturally link to other concepts
- **Explanation:** "Visualization worked best! Shapes are pictures, so making a mental image of them in order-maybe stacked or in a line-helps your visual memory store the sequence."

**Audio:** Upbeat, triumphant celebration music (15 seconds)

**CONTINUITY NOTE**

**Link to Prior/Future Lessons:**

**Connection to Lesson 1:** Builds on foundation of WHAT memory stores (names, skills, stories, facts). Now students learn they can actively strengthen storage of ALL those types through strategic tools.

**Connection to Lesson 2:** Directly builds on HOW memory works (notice → store → retrieve). Today's strategies enhance Stage 1 (noticing) and Stage 2 (storing). Lesson 2 established that attention strengthens memory; Lesson 3 shows that strategic attention (using specific techniques) strengthens it even more.

**Foundation for Lesson 4:** Next lesson will explain that memories are imperfect and differ between people. Understanding strategies provides context: even with strategies, memory isn't perfect-and that's normal. Strategies help but don't eliminate variation.

**Psychology-as-Science Thread:** This game models experimental method-manipulating variables (strategy choice) and observing outcomes (memory strength). Students conduct repeated trials to identify patterns, mirroring how psychologists test memory interventions. The comparative testing (all 4 strategies per trial) makes cause-effect relationships observable.

**Self-Efficacy Building:** Unlike previous lessons (understanding what/how memory works), this lesson shifts to agency: "I can DO something to improve memory." The game provides immediate evidence that strategic choices improve outcomes, building the core belief "I can help my memory work better."

**Unit Arc:**

- Lesson 1: WHAT memory does (stores information)
- Lesson 2: HOW memory works (three-stage process)
- **Lesson 3: How to STRENGTHEN memory (strategic tools)** ← Current game
- Lesson 4: Why memories DIFFER (constructive nature, normalizing imperfection)

## In-Class-Game 4D – Perspectives Gallery

**Lesson 4: Memories Are Different - And That's Okay**

**Learning Objectives:**

- Explain that memory is constructive - it rebuilds experiences rather than recording them perfectly like a camera
- Recognize that two people may remember the same event differently based on what each person noticed and thought was important
- Provide an example from class or personal experience where classmates remembered different details of the same event
- Distinguish between forgetting (normal memory process) and being "wrong" or "bad at memory"
- Demonstrate empathy and perspective-taking by accepting that different memories of the same event are all valid reflections of what stood out to each person

**GAME FILE NAME: icg-04.04-game01.html**

**GAME TITLE:** Perspectives Gallery

**GAME FORMAT:** Perspective Switch

**Format Justification:** This format has only 1 prior use and is pedagogically ideal for Lesson 4's objective of demonstrating that memory is constructive and varies by perspective. Students observe identical events from multiple characters' viewpoints, then compare how each character remembers different details based on what they noticed and valued. This direct comparison makes the constructive nature of memory observable: students SEE that memory isn't recording (all characters would remember identically) but rebuilding (each character reconstructs based on personal attention and priorities). The format builds empathy by validating all perspectives as "correct" reconstructions, normalizing memory variability without judgment.

**Format Status:** Available (1 use in Round 1)

**PURPOSE:** Students discover that memory is constructive-not a perfect recording-by observing the same scenes from different characters' perspectives. They learn that what each person notices depends on their focus, interests, and attention, making different memories of the same event equally valid. This builds empathy and normalizes memory variation while reinforcing that forgetting or remembering differently is not "being wrong."

**LESSON ARC LOCATION:** 16-26 minutes into the 45-minute lesson. AFTER (16-20M) Practice demonstrating memory differences (e.g., recall shared experience). IN-CLASS GAME - "Perspective Gallery: What Did You Notice?". BEFORE Reflection: Post-game empathy discussion - applying understanding to real friendships and conflicts.

**Pedagogical Justification:** Game serves as perspective-taking practice after conceptual grounding. Students have just learned that memory is constructive (rebuilds rather than records) and that different people notice different things. The game transforms this abstract concept into observable comparison through 6 multi-perspective scenarios. By repeatedly seeing that ALL characters' memories are "correct" (each truly remembered what they noticed), students internalize that memory variability isn't about being "wrong"-it's about selective attention and personal salience. Placement before final discussion allows teacher to connect game observations to real-world peer interactions and conflict resolution ("When your friend remembers differently, they're not wrong-they noticed different things").

**SETUP**

**Opening Screen**

**Visual Layout:**

- **Background:** Art gallery setting with picture frames on walls, spotlights, clean white space
- **Title Banner (top):** "Perspective Gallery: What Did You Notice?" in elegant, friendly font
- **Subtitle:** "Same event, different memories-and they're all correct!"

**Center Stage: The Gallery Display**

- Large central frame (like a window or screen) labeled "THE EVENT"
- Three smaller frames arranged below labeled "MEMORY 1", "MEMORY 2", "MEMORY 3"
- All frames initially empty with gentle glow

**Character Introduction:**

- **Avatar:** "Dr. Memory" (same character from Lessons 1 & 2 - maintaining continuity throughout unit)
- **Position:** Standing beside the gallery as a museum guide
- **Speech Bubble:** "Welcome to the Perspective Gallery! Today we'll discover something fascinating: when different people experience the SAME event, they each remember DIFFERENT details. That's not wrong-that's how memory works! Memory isn't like a camera. It rebuilds what YOU noticed, and everyone notices different things."

**Three Character Avatars Displayed (sidebar/bottom):** These characters will be the "rememberers" throughout the game:

- **Character A - "Alex"** - Child with red shirt, holding a sketchbook (notices visual details, colors, art)
- **Character B - "Jordan"** - Child with green shirt, holding a ball (notices action, movement, games)
- **Character C - "Sam"** - Child with blue shirt, holding headphones (notices sounds, music, conversations)

**Visual cue for each character shows their "focus":**

- Alex has a paintbrush icon floating near them
- Jordan has a running shoe icon
- Sam has a musical note icon

**Bottom UI Elements:**

- **Score Display (bottom left):** "Perspective Points: 0" with eye icons
- **Memory Detective Badge (bottom center):** Empty badge outline that fills as students progress
- **Clicker Guide (bottom right):** "Buttons 1-3 = Choose which memory | Button 4 = All are correct"

**Audio:** Gentle, contemplative background music (calm, curious tone)

**Interaction:** Teacher clicks "Enter the Gallery" button or presses clicker button 5 to begin

**PLAY**

**Game Structure**

The game consists of 6 scenarios (events). For each scenario, students observe the SAME event from three different characters' perspectives, then answer questions about why memories differ and which memory is "correct."

**SCENARIO PRESENTATION CYCLE (Repeats 6 times)**

**PHASE 1: EVENT PRESENTATION - "What Happened" (15 seconds)**

**Screen Layout:**

- **Large central frame labeled "THE EVENT" activates and displays**

**Event Animation/Illustration:** A short, visually rich scene plays out showing a common childhood experience. The event contains MULTIPLE details across different sensory channels (visual, auditory, action-based).

**Example Event (Scenario 1):**

- **Setting:** Playground at recess
- **What Happens:** A teacher walks onto the playground carrying a box of new balls. She's wearing a bright yellow jacket. She places the box down, and children run over. A bird chirps loudly in a nearby tree. The teacher says, "We have three new red balls for everyone!" Children start playing.

**Event Display:**

- Animated illustration showing ALL elements simultaneously:
  - Teacher in yellow jacket
  - Box of red balls
  - Children running
  - Bird visible in tree
  - Sound effect: bird chirping
  - Teacher's speech bubble: "We have three new red balls!"

**Visual Richness:** The event intentionally includes:

- Visual details (colors, objects, people)
- Auditory details (sounds, speech)
- Action details (movement, activity)
- Multiple simultaneous elements (parallel activities)

**Dr. Memory Narration (text at bottom):** "Watch carefully! Three friends-Alex, Jordan, and Sam-all experienced this same moment. But they each noticed different things..."

**No Questions Yet:** Students simply observe the complete event

**Duration:** Event plays once, 10-15 seconds total

**PHASE 2: THREE MEMORY PERSPECTIVES (30 seconds)**

**Screen Update:**

- Central frame (THE EVENT) shrinks and moves to top of screen (remains visible for reference)
- **Three memory frames below activate sequentially, showing each character's reconstruction**

**MEMORY 1: Alex's Memory (Visual Focus)**

**Frame labeled "ALEX'S MEMORY" lights up**

**What Alex Remembered:**

- "I remember the teacher was wearing a really bright YELLOW jacket-like sunshine! And the balls were RED. I loved those colors together!"

**Visual Display:**

- Illustration shows the scene from Alex's memory
- **Emphasized details:** Teacher's yellow jacket is BRIGHT and detailed, red balls are vivid
- **De-emphasized details:** Bird is barely visible/faded, children's faces are blurred, sound is absent
- Visual style: Like a painting with some parts in focus (colors) and others hazy

**Alex's Avatar appears beside memory:**

- Thought bubble: "I notice colors and what things look like!"
- Paintbrush icon glows

**MEMORY 2: Jordan's Memory (Action Focus)**

**Frame labeled "JORDAN'S MEMORY" lights up**

**What Jordan Remembered:**

- "I remember all the kids RAN over really fast when the teacher put the box down! We were so excited to play with the balls. I grabbed one first and started bouncing it!"

**Visual Display:**

- Illustration shows the scene from Jordan's memory
- **Emphasized details:** Children running with motion lines, clear movement, action poses detailed
- **De-emphasized details:** Teacher's jacket is generic/colorless, bird absent, exact ball color unclear
- Visual style: Dynamic, showing motion and activity clearly while static details are vague

**Jordan's Avatar appears beside memory:**

- Thought bubble: "I notice movement and what people DO!"
- Running shoe icon glows

**MEMORY 3: Sam's Memory (Auditory Focus)**

**Frame labeled "SAM'S MEMORY" lights up**

**What Sam Remembered:**

- "I remember hearing a BIRD singing really loudly in the tree! And the teacher SAID 'We have three new balls.' I was listening to the sounds."

**Visual Display:**

- Illustration shows the scene from Sam's memory
- **Emphasized details:** Bird is large and prominent with musical notes, teacher's speech bubble is clear and detailed
- **De-emphasized details:** Teacher's jacket color is unclear, children are shadowy figures, ball color is vague
- Visual style: Sound elements are visual (notes, waves) while visual details are muted

**Sam's Avatar appears beside memory:**

- Thought bubble: "I notice sounds and what people SAY!"
- Musical note icon glows

**After All Three Memories Displayed:**

**Dr. Memory Appears (center):** "Three friends, ONE event, THREE different memories! Each person remembered what THEY noticed. Let's think about this..."

**Visual Comparison Display:**

- All three memory frames remain visible side-by-side
- Original event frame at top for reference
- Differences are visually obvious

**PHASE 3: UNDERSTANDING QUESTION (20 seconds)**

**Screen Layout:**

- Three memory frames remain visible for reference
- **Question appears in center:**

**Question 1 Type - "Why Different?" Question:**

**Large text prompt:** "WHY do Alex, Jordan, and Sam remember different details?"

**Four answer options appear (clicker buttons 1-4):**

**Button 1:** "Because some of them have BAD memory" **Button 2:** "Because they each NOTICED different things" **Button 3:** "Because some of them are WRONG" **Button 4:** "Because they weren't PAYING ATTENTION"

**Correct Answer:** Button 2

**Clicker Instructions (highlighted):** "Use your clicker to choose: Press 1, 2, 3, or 4"

**Dr. Memory Prompt:** "Think about what you learned. Why are their memories different?"

**Student Action:** Each student uses clicker to select their answer (buttons 1-4)

**Response Collection:**

- Buttons pulse as votes come in
- Counter: "Answers received: 18/20"
- No results shown yet

**PHASE 4: ANSWER REVEAL & TEACHING (15 seconds)**

**Screen Update:**

- Correct answer (Button 2) is highlighted with gold border and checkmark
- Incorrect answers fade slightly

**Dr. Memory Explanation (speech bubble with emphasis):**

"YES! They each NOTICED different things. Memory isn't like a camera that records everything exactly. Memory REBUILDS experiences using what YOU noticed. Alex noticed COLORS, Jordan noticed ACTION, and Sam noticed SOUNDS. They were all paying attention-just to different things!"

**Key Learning Box Appears (highlighted):** "Memory is CONSTRUCTIVE: It rebuilds from what you noticed, not records like a camera."

**Visual Reinforcement:**

- Three character avatars appear with their "focus icons" glowing
- Arrows point from each character to what they noticed in the original event
- Text: "Different focus → Different memories"

**Scoring:**

- **Correct answer (Button 2):** +2 Perspective Points, "You understand how memory works!"
- **Incorrect answer:** +1 Perspective Point (participation), brief gentle correction shown

**Individual Feedback:**

- Student's clicker displays whether they answered correctly
- All students see the explanation (learning opportunity)

**PHASE 5: VALIDATION QUESTION (20 seconds)**

**Screen Layout:**

- Three memory frames still visible
- **New question appears:**

**Question 2 Type - "Who's Correct?" Question:**

**Large text prompt:** "Which memory is CORRECT?"

**Four answer options appear:**

**Button 1:** "Only ALEX'S memory is correct" **Button 2:** "Only JORDAN'S memory is correct" **Button 3:** "Only SAM'S memory is correct" **Button 4:** "ALL three memories are correct"

**Correct Answer:** Button 4

**Clicker Instructions:** "Use your clicker: Press 1, 2, 3, or 4"

**Dr. Memory Prompt:** "Think carefully! Who remembered correctly?"

**Student Action:** Students use clicker to select answer

**Response Collection:**

- Visual feedback as votes collected
- Counter updates

**PHASE 6: EMPATHY TEACHING & VALIDATION (15 seconds)**

**Screen Update:**

- Correct answer (Button 4) highlighted with gold border and checkmark
- All three memory frames glow equally with positive light

**Dr. Memory Explanation (emphatic, warm tone):**

"EXACTLY! ALL three memories are CORRECT! Each friend truly remembered what THEY noticed. Alex really saw those colors. Jordan really noticed the running. Sam really heard the bird. They're not wrong-they each rebuilt the memory from different pieces. That's how ALL memory works!"

**Key Learning Box (large, centered):** "Different memories of the same event are ALL VALID-they show what each person noticed."

**Empathy Message (highlighted):** "When someone remembers differently than you, they're not WRONG. They just noticed different things!"

**Visual Reinforcement:**

- All three characters appear together, smiling
- Checkmarks appear over all three memories
- Text: "All correct! ✓ ✓ ✓"

**Scoring:**

- **Correct answer (Button 4):** +3 Perspective Points, "You understand memory AND empathy!"
- **Incorrect answer (Buttons 1-3):** +1 Point, gentle teaching: "Remember: each person's memory shows what THEY noticed-all are real memories!"

**Memory Detective Badge:**

- Badge outline fills progressively (1/6 complete after Scenario 1)
- Encourages completion of all scenarios

**PHASE 7: TRANSITION TO NEXT SCENARIO (5 seconds)**

**Screen Reset:**

- Memory frames fade
- Gallery returns to neutral state
- Progress indicator updates

**Progress Display:**

- "Scenarios explored: \[X\]/6"
- "Perspective Points: \[XX\]"
- Memory Detective Badge: \[X/6\] filled

**Dr. Memory:** "Ready to explore another perspective? Let's see another event through different eyes!"

**Interaction:**

- Teacher clicks "Next Event" or presses clicker button 5
- Brief transition: gallery lights shift, new frames prepare

**KEY LEARNING SUMMARY (Middle section)**

**"WHAT WE DISCOVERED ABOUT MEMORY:" Header**

**The Big Ideas (illustrated with icons and examples):**

**1\. Memory Is Constructive**

- Icon: Memory "rebuilding" blocks vs. camera "recording"
- Text: "Memory doesn't record like a camera. It REBUILDS experiences from what you noticed."

**2\. Everyone Notices Different Things**

- Icon: Three characters with different "focus" icons (paint, shoe, note)
- Text: "Alex noticed COLORS. Jordan noticed ACTIONS. Sam noticed SOUNDS. What you notice depends on what you pay attention to!"

**3\. Different Memories Are All Valid**

- Icon: Three checkmarks, all glowing
- Text: "When two people remember differently, BOTH memories are correct! Each person truly remembered what THEY noticed."

**4\. Forgetting Is Normal**

- Icon: Faded memory with acceptance symbol
- Text: "Sometimes we forget details. That's normal! Memory doesn't store everything-just what we noticed."

**Character Examples (visual summary):**

- Small panel showing all three characters with their remembered details from one scenario
- Caption: "Same event, different memories-and they're ALL correct!"

**EMPATHY & REAL-WORLD APPLICATION (Bottom section)**

**"HOW THIS HELPS IN REAL LIFE:" Header**

**Empowerment Statement (large, highlighted box):** "When someone remembers differently than me, they're not WRONG. They just noticed different things. That's normal and okay!"

**Real-World Scenarios (illustrated):**

**Scenario 1: Friendship Conflicts**

- Illustration: Two friends talking
- Text: "Your friend says 'Remember when we played at the park and the swings were broken?' But you remember the slide was broken. You're BOTH right-you each noticed different things!"

**Scenario 2: Family Stories**

- Illustration: Family at dinner table
- Text: "Your mom remembers your birthday party one way. Your dad remembers it differently. They're both sharing true memories from what THEY noticed!"

**Scenario 3: Classroom Experiences**

- Illustration: Students discussing
- Text: "Your classmate remembers different parts of the field trip. That doesn't mean your memory is wrong-you each paid attention to different things!"

**Empathy Message (highlighted):** "Understanding that memory is different for everyone helps us be KIND and UNDERSTANDING when memories don't match!"

**CLASS DISCOVERIES (Bottom section)**

**"OUR CLASS LEARNED:" Header**

**Class Performance Summary:**

- Percentage of class that recognized "all memories are correct" by final scenario
- **Example display:** "By scenario 6, 95% of our class knew all three memories were valid!"
- "We're becoming more empathetic and understanding!"

**Most Common Learning Pattern:**

- If class improved across scenarios: "Our class grew in understanding! We learned that different doesn't mean wrong."
- If class understood early: "Our class understood right away that all perspectives are valid!"

**POST-GAME REFLECTION PROMPTS (For Teacher)**

**Screen shows discussion prompts:** "Teacher: Discuss with your class..."

- "Can you think of a time when you and a friend remembered something differently? Why did that happen?"
- "If someone remembers a different detail than you, does that mean they're wrong?"
- "How can understanding that memories are different help us be better friends?"
- "What would you say to someone who feels bad about forgetting something?"

**Suggested Teacher Talking Points (on screen):**

- "Forgetting is NORMAL-memory doesn't store everything"
- "Different memories show different perspectives, not right vs. wrong"
- "Being understanding when memories differ builds empathy and kindness"

**DR. MEMORY'S FINAL MESSAGE**

**Large speech bubble (center):**

"You've learned something powerful today! Memory isn't perfect, and that's okay. When you forget something, your memory isn't broken-it's working normally. When your friend remembers differently, they're not wrong-they noticed different things than you did. Understanding how memory really works helps you be kind to yourself AND to others!"

**Final Empowerment Box (highlighted, large):** "I understand that my memory and others' memories work by noticing and rebuilding. Different memories are all valid, and forgetting is normal!"

**Audio:** Warm, gentle celebration music (15 seconds, not triumphant but validating and peaceful)

**CONTINUITY NOTE**

**Link to Prior/Future Lessons:**

**Connection to Lesson 1:** Completes the arc from WHAT memory stores. Lesson 1 established that memory stores names, skills, stories, facts. Lesson 4 reveals that WHAT gets stored depends on WHAT you noticed-explaining why different people store different details from the same experience.

**Connection to Lesson 2:** Builds directly on HOW memory works (notice → store → retrieve). Lesson 2 showed that attention determines what gets stored. Lesson 4 extends this: because everyone's attention focuses differently, everyone stores (and retrieves) different pieces. The three-stage model explains why perspectives vary.

**Connection to Lesson 3:** Contextualizes the strategies taught. Lesson 3 showed memory can be strengthened with tools (repetition, association, storytelling, visualization). Lesson 4 adds realism: even WITH strategies, memory remains imperfect and variable because it's constructive, not recorded. Strategies help but don't eliminate normal memory characteristics.

**Unit Completion:** This is the final lesson, bringing the unit full circle:

- Lesson 1: Memory as observable function (WHAT it stores)
- Lesson 2: Memory as process (HOW it works via three stages)
- Lesson 3: Memory as improvable skill (HOW to strengthen it)
- **Lesson 4: Memory as imperfect and variable (WHY that's normal and okay)** ← Current game

**Psychology-as-Science Thread:** This game models perspective-taking and comparative analysis-core research methods in psychology. Students observe multiple reconstructions of identical stimuli, identify patterns in how attention shapes memory, and draw conclusions about memory's constructive nature. This mirrors how psychologists study eyewitness testimony and memory reliability.
