## Home Game 3A – Memory Strategy Defenders
> Jump to: [Setup](#setup) · [Play](#play) · [Scoring](#scoring) · [Win Condition](#win-condition) · [Continuity Note](#continuity-note)

### Learning Objective
Students will identify and apply memory strategies (repetition, association, storytelling, visualization) to improve recall.

### Game File Name & Format
`hg-04.03-01.html` — Tower Defense (Adapted)

### Game Purpose
This game transforms abstract memory strategies into spatial, strategic tools. By positioning strategies along information pathways and observing their strengthening effects, students learn which strategies work best for different types of information and how combining strategies creates stronger memories.

### Estimated Play Time
9–10 minutes (5 waves × ~2 minutes each)

---

### Setup
**Opening Screen:**
- Cartoon brain landscape with winding pathways leading to central "Memory Vault"  
- Character (brain guardian with shield) explains:  
  > "Information travels these paths to your memory vault, but 'Forgetting Fog' tries to weaken it! Place memory strategy towers to make the information stronger!"  
- Four tower types shown with icons:  
  - **REPETITION TOWER** (circular arrows) – “Makes info repeat”  
  - **ASSOCIATION TOWER** (chain links) – “Connects to what you know”  
  - **STORY TOWER** (book with stars) – “Weaves info into stories”  
  - **VISUALIZATION TOWER** (eye with sparkle) – “Creates mental pictures”  
- “Defend Your Memory!” button  

---

### Play
**Step-by-step gameplay:**

#### WAVE 1: Single Information Type (Tutorial)
**Map Layout:**
- Winding path from entrance (top) to memory vault (center)  
- Path has 8–10 positions where towers can be placed (marked spots)  
- Player has 100 "Strategy Points" to spend  
- Each tower costs 25 points (can place 4 towers)  

**Information Incoming:**
- Announcement: “Wave 1: NUMBER INFORMATION coming! (Phone number: 555-1234)”  
- Information appears as glowing orb traveling slowly down path  
- Orb has “strength bar” above it (starts at 50%)  
- Visual: Numbers visible inside orb  

**Tower Placement:**
- Player taps/clicks empty tower spot  
- Menu appears with 4 tower options  
- Player selects REPETITION TOWER (optimal for numbers)  
- Tower builds with animation (2 seconds)  

**Tower Effect:**
- When information orb passes through tower’s range:  
  - REPETITION TOWER: Numbers appear multiple times around orb, strength bar increases +20%  
  - Tower animation shows numbers repeating: “555-1234… 555-1234… 555-1234”  
  - Orb glows brighter, moves forward  

**Forgetting Fog:**
- Gray fog clouds drift onto path from sides  
- If orb touches fog without tower protection, strength bar decreases –10%  
- Towers have "range circles" that repel fog  
- Strategic placement needed to cover vulnerable path sections  

**Reaching Memory Vault:**
- Orb reaches vault at center  
- Strength level determines storage success:  
  - 0–40%: Weak storage (faded icon, might be forgotten)  
  - 41–70%: Medium storage (clear icon)  
  - 71–100%: Strong storage (bright, glowing icon)  
- Immediate feedback: “Phone number stored at [X%] strength!”  

**Retrieval Test:**
- After wave completes, quick test: “What was the phone number?”  
- Player types answer  
- Success based on storage strength (stronger = easier recall)  

#### WAVE 2: Different Information Type
**New Challenge:**
- “Wave 2: NAME INFORMATION coming! (New friend: Lily who loves lilies)”  
- Player must choose different strategy  
- ASSOCIATION TOWER is optimal (connecting name to flower)  
- If player uses wrong tower (e.g., repetition), still works but less effective (+10% instead of +20%)  
- Game gently teaches: “That worked, but ASSOCIATION towers work even better for names!”  

#### WAVE 3–5: Increasing Complexity
**Multiple Orbs:**
- Wave 3: TWO information orbs traveling path simultaneously  
- One number, one name  
- Player must place multiple towers or choose versatile placement  

**Multiple Paths:**
- Wave 4: Path splits into two routes to vault  
- Must defend both paths with limited tower budget  
- Strategic choices required  

**Boss Wave:**
- Wave 5: “COMPLEX INFORMATION – A story with characters, places, and events”  
- Large orb moves slowly  
- Benefits from ALL tower types (combination strategy)  
- Player learns: combining strategies = strongest memory  

**Strategy Combinations:**
- Tower Synergies:  
  - Placing two different tower types near each other creates "combo effects":  
    - Repetition + Visualization = "Repeated mental images" (+30% instead of +20%)  
    - Story + Association = "Connected narrative" (+35%)  
  - Visual: Towers link with glowing connection  
  - Game teaches advanced strategy use  

**Upgrade System:**
- Successfully stored memories earn Strategy Points  
- Spend points to upgrade towers:  
  - Level 2: Larger range, stronger effect  
  - Level 3: Faster activation, combo bonuses  
- Encourages experimentation and replay

### Scoring
**Strategic Defense Scoring:**
- Base points: 50 per information orb successfully stored  
- Strength bonus: Extra points based on final strength (71–100% = +30 points)  
- Tower efficiency: Use fewer towers for same result = +20 points  
- Combo bonus: Create tower synergies = +40 points per combo  
- Perfect wave: All orbs stored at 90%+ strength = +100 points  
- Retrieval success: Correctly recall tested information = +25 points each  
- **Total maximum: ~600 points (5 waves)**  

**Defense Ranks:**  
- Memory Cadet: 200–350 points  
- Strategy Captain: 351–500 points  
- Master Defender: 501–600 points

### Win Condition
Game completes after defending all 5 waves.  
Final screen shows:
- Memory vault full of glowing stored information  
- Strategy effectiveness chart showing which towers worked best for which info types  
- Achievement rank badge  
- Message:  
  > “You defended your memory vault! You discovered that different strategies work better for different types of information. Repetition strengthens numbers, Association connects names, Stories link events, and Visualization creates mental pictures. Use these strategies to make your memories stronger!”

**Return Navigation:**
- “Defend Again” button (replay with different waves)  
- “Return to Home Games” button (links to `hg-04.03.html`)  
- “Return to Lesson” button (links to `lesson-04.03.html`)

### Continuity Note
This game operationalizes Lesson 3’s four strategies through spatial-strategic gameplay. By requiring players to match strategies to information types and observe real-time effectiveness, the game builds both declarative knowledge (what the strategies are) and procedural knowledge (when to use them). This prepares for Lesson 4’s acceptance that even with good strategies, memory variability is normal.

### Play
**Step-by-step gameplay:**

#### LEVEL 1: Rush Hour Begins (Tutorial)
**Customer Arrival:**
- First customer (cartoon child) sits at seat 1  
- Speech bubble: “I need to remember my friend’s phone number: 555-7890. Can you help?”  
- Order ticket appears: “PHONE NUMBER” with timer (30 seconds)  

**Strategy Selection:**
- Player taps correct strategy machine  
- For phone numbers, REPETITION STATION is optimal

**Serving & Feedback:**
- Completed strategy “served” with animation  
- Customer’s face lights up: “Thanks! I can remember it now!”  
- Customer leaves, drops “memory gem” as payment  
- Wrong strategy → partial success (“That helped a little...”) = half payment  

**Timer Pressure:**
- If timer runs out, customer leaves disappointed  
- No payment earned  
- Feedback: “Too slow! Try to match strategies faster!”  

#### LEVEL 2–3: Multiple Customers

## How Lesson 3 Fits into the Full Learning Arc

Lesson 3 deepens children’s understanding of memory by turning **knowledge into skill**. After Lesson 2’s exploration of how memory forms through noticing, storing, and retrieving, this lesson empowers students to see memory as something they can strengthen deliberately. The two home games transform abstract “memory tricks” into lived experiences—through strategy placement in *Memory Strategy Defenders* and quick decision-making in *Memory Strategy Café*, children test and observe how repetition, association, storytelling, and visualization each enhance recall.

Together, these games bridge **understanding and self-efficacy**: students not only know that memory can be trained but feel capable of doing so themselves. This builds confidence in their ability to influence their own learning—a key step toward resilience. The learning arc then naturally moves to Lesson 4, which expands perspective by normalizing that even skilled, strategic minds remember differently and sometimes forget—and that’s perfectly normal.

> 🧠 **Learning Arc Summary:** Process → Strategy → Perspective.  
> Through these stages, children progress from understanding *how* memory works to *how they can work with it*, nurturing both psychological literacy and confidence in their own cognitive abilities.
