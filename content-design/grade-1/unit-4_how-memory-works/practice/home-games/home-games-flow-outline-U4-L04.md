## Home Game 4A – Shattered Memories – Puzzle Reconstruction
> Jump to: [Setup](#setup) · [Play](#play) · [Scoring](#scoring) · [Win Condition](#win-condition) · [Continuity Note](#continuity-note)

### Learning Objective
Students will understand that memory is constructive (rebuilds from pieces) rather than a perfect recording, and that different people remember the same event differently.

### Game File Name & Format
`hg-04.04-01.html` — Puzzle Reveal/Jigsaw

### Game Purpose
This game makes the constructive nature of memory tangible through literal reconstruction. By physically assembling memory fragments—some clear, some faded, some possibly incorrect—students experience how memory rebuilds experiences from pieces, not perfect recordings.

### Estimated Play Time
9–10 minutes (Sam's puzzle 3 min, Alex's puzzle 3 min, comparison 2 min, bonus 2 min)

---

### Setup
**Opening Screen:**
- Split scene showing two cartoon children (Sam and Alex) looking thoughtful  
- Between them: Shattered puzzle pieces floating in space  
- Character guide appears: "Sam and Alex went to the same birthday party yesterday. Now they're trying to remember what happened. Help them rebuild their memories from the pieces their brains stored!"  
- Scattered puzzle pieces visible (20–24 pieces total)  
- "Start Rebuilding" button  

---

### Play
**Step-by-step gameplay:**

#### PART 1: Sam's Memory Reconstruction
1. **Memory Selection:**  
   - "First, let's help Sam remember the birthday party"  
   - Empty 4×3 puzzle frame appears (12 spaces)  
   - Floating puzzle pieces surround the frame (18 total pieces available, but only 12 fit)  
   - Pieces have different qualities:  
     - Clear & bright (strongly encoded - 5 pieces)  
     - Faded/fuzzy (weakly encoded - 4 pieces)  
     - Slightly distorted (altered in memory - 2 pieces)  
     - Wrong event pieces (from different memories - 7 decoy pieces)  

2. **Piece Examination:**  
   - Player can tap any piece to examine it closely  
   - Magnified view shows detail with caption  
   - Examples:  
     - Clear piece: "The birthday cake - chocolate with blue frosting"  
     - Faded piece: "Balloons... maybe red? Hard to remember..."  
     - Distorted piece: "The birthday girl wore a green dress" (actually was yellow)  
     - Wrong piece: "Playing at the beach" (that was a different day)  

3. **Puzzle Building:**  
   - Player drags pieces into the 12-space frame  
   - Perfect fit pieces (8-9 available):  
     - Click into place with satisfying snap  
     - Piece glows briefly when placed correctly  
     - Sound: gentle "click"  
   - Imperfect fit pieces (faded/distorted):  
     - Fit into spaces but show visual "shimmer" (memory uncertainty)  
     - Game accepts placement but shows fuzziness  
     - Sound: softer, less certain "click"  
   - Wrong pieces:  
     - Bounce back gently when dragged to frame  
     - Feedback: "This doesn't match the party memory"  
   - Empty spaces:  
     - Some puzzle spaces (2-3) have NO matching pieces  
     - These represent forgotten/unnoticed details  
     - Stay empty - shown with subtle outline  

4. **Guided Hints:**  
   - After 30 seconds, gentle hint system activates  
   - "Need help? Tap the magnifying glass for a hint"  
   - Hint highlights one correct piece with gentle pulse  
   - Unlimited hints available (no penalty - learning focused)  

5. **Sam's Complete Memory:**  
   - After placing all available fitting pieces (9-10 placed, 2-3 spaces empty)  
   - Frame fills in: assembled pieces reveal party scene from Sam's perspective  
   - Clear areas show: cake table, some friends, decorations  
   - Fuzzy areas show: uncertain details (balloon colors)  
   - Empty spaces remain gray: "Sam didn't store these details"  
   - Caption: "This is how Sam's memory rebuilt the party! Some parts are clear, some are fuzzy, and some are missing. That's how memory works!"  

---

#### PART 2: Alex's Memory Reconstruction
6. **Second Perspective:**  
   - "Now let's help Alex remember the SAME party"  
   - Sam's completed puzzle slides to left side of screen  
   - New empty 4×3 frame appears on right  
   - DIFFERENT set of 18 pieces appears for Alex  
   - Same event, but:  
     - Alex has clear pieces for things Sam forgot (the games they played)  
     - Alex has fuzzy/missing pieces for things Sam remembered clearly (cake details)  
     - Alex's distorted pieces show different errors (remembered different people)  
     - Different aspects were strongly encoded  

7. **Building Alex's Memory:**  
   - Same mechanics as Sam's puzzle  
   - Player builds using Alex's available pieces  
   - Notice the differences:  
     - "Alex remembered the musical chairs game clearly!"  
     - "Alex barely remembers the cake..."  
     - "Alex thought there were 3 tables, not 2"  
   - Different sections are clear vs. missing vs. fuzzy  
   - 2-3 spaces empty (different ones than Sam's)  

8. **Alex's Complete Memory:**  
   - Reveals Alex's reconstructed party image  
   - Visually different from Sam's version  
   - Clear sections: games, different friends, playground area  
   - Fuzzy sections: decorations, food  
   - Missing sections: different details than Sam's gaps  
   - Both puzzles now visible side-by-side  

---

#### PART 3: Comparison & Discovery
9. **Side-by-Side Display:**  
   - Both completed puzzles remain on screen  
   - Interactive overlay appears showing:  
     - GREEN highlights: Details both remembered similarly  
     - BLUE highlights: Details remembered differently  
     - GRAY areas: Sections one or both forgot  
   - Percentage shown: "67% overlap, 33% different"  

10. **Interactive Comparison:**  
    - Player can tap highlighted areas to see both perspectives  
    - Examples:  
      - Tap balloon area:  
        - "Sam remembered: 'Orange balloons'"  
        - "Alex remembered: 'Red balloons'"  
        - "Both are building from memory pieces - neither is wrong!"  
      - Tap cake area:  
        - "Sam remembered: 'Chocolate cake, blue frosting, 6 candles'"  
        - "Alex remembered: '...there was cake...'"  
        - "Sam paid more attention to the cake!"  
      - Tap games area:  
        - "Sam remembered: '...we played something...'"  
        - "Alex remembered: 'Musical chairs, then tag, then balloon toss'"  
        - "Alex paid more attention to the games!"  

11. **Discovery Moment:**  
    - Character guide appears: "Look at that! Sam and Alex were at the SAME party, but their memories are different!"  
    - Interactive quiz: "Why are their memories different?"  
    - Three options (all validated):  
      - "They noticed different things" ✓  
      - "They paid attention to different parts" ✓  
      - "Memory rebuilds from what YOU stored, not everything" ✓  
    - Player taps answer(s)  
    - Feedback: "Exactly right! Memory is constructive - it rebuilds from pieces you noticed and stored. Everyone's memory of the same event is different because everyone notices different things. And that's perfectly okay!"  

---

#### PART 4: Your Turn (Bonus Round)
12. **Player's Own Memory Challenge:**  
    - "Now let's test YOUR memory reconstruction!"  
    - 10-second video clip plays showing a busy party scene  
    - Rich with details: decorations, people, activities, colors, objects  
    - After viewing, player builds their own memory puzzle  
    - Same mechanics: some pieces clear, some fuzzy, some missing  
    - Compare to "accurate" reference image  
    - Game shows: "You remembered these parts clearly, and missed these parts. Just like Sam and Alex!"  

13. **Final Reflection:**  
    - "Would your friend remember the same things?"  
    - Show hypothetical friend's puzzle of the same clip (different pieces selected)  
    - Reinforces: everyone's memory is unique and valid

### Continuity Note
This game brings the unit full circle. Students began by understanding memory as storage (Lesson 1), learned how information enters storage through attention (Lesson 2), practiced strengthening storage (Lesson 3), and now understand storage's natural limitations and variability (Lesson 4). The jigsaw metaphor perfectly captures constructive memory: pieces are stored, then reassembled—not perfectly recalled. This builds empathy and self-compassion.

## Home Game 4B – Memory Lane Runner
> Jump to: [Setup](#setup-1) · [Play](#play-1) · [Scoring](#scoring-1) · [Win Condition](#win-condition-1) · [Continuity Note](#continuity-note-1)

### Learning Objective
Students will demonstrate empathy and perspective-taking by recognizing that different memories of the same event are all valid, and that forgetting is a normal part of how memory works.

### Game File Name & Format
`hg-04.04-02.html` — Endless Runner (Adapted)

### Game Purpose
This game uses the kinetic energy of an endless runner to demonstrate memory's selectivity and variability. By actively choosing which fragments to collect while running (limited capacity = selective attention), students experience why different people remember different aspects of the same event. The game normalizes missing fragments as part of natural memory function.

### Estimated Play Time
8–10 minutes (First run 2 min, Second run 2 min, Comparison 2 min, Optional challenge 2–3 min)

---

### Setup
**Opening Screen:**
- Bright, winding pathway stretching into distance labeled "Memory Lane"  
- Three playable characters standing at starting line:  
  - Maya (loves colors and art)  
  - Diego (notices movement and action)  
  - Zara (pays attention to people and faces)  
- Character guide appears: "Welcome to Memory Lane! Everyone runs down the same path, but everyone collects different memory pieces. Choose your runner and see what YOU remember!"  
- "Choose Your Runner" buttons appear under each character  
- Preview shows path ahead with floating memory fragments  

---

### Play
**Step-by-step gameplay:**

#### PART 1: First Run - Player Choice
1. **Character Selection:**  
   - Player taps one of three characters (Maya, Diego, or Zara)  
   - Selected character steps forward  
   - Brief intro: "Maya notices colors and patterns best!" (or appropriate for selected character)  
   - "Ready to Run!" button appears  

2. **Running Begins:**  
   - Memory Lane appears in 3D perspective (path scrolling toward player)  
   - Character automatically runs forward at steady pace  
   - Path has three lanes (left, center, right)  
   - Player swipes left/right to change lanes (or arrow keys)  
   - Simple jump mechanic: swipe up/tap to jump over obstacles  

3. **Memory Fragments Appear:**  
   - Glowing memory orbs float above the path  
   - Three types based on what happened at "the school field trip":  
     - VISUAL fragments (colors, sights): Yellow orbs with eye icon  
     - ACTION fragments (movement, activities): Green orbs with running icon  
     - SOCIAL fragments (people, interactions): Blue orbs with face icon  
   - Fragments appear mixed across all three lanes  
   - Character must be in correct lane to collect (run through orb)  

4. **Character Strengths:**  
   - Based on selected character, certain fragments glow brighter:  
     - Maya: Visual fragments glow brightest (easiest to see and collect)  
     - Diego: Action fragments glow brightest  
     - Zara: Social fragments glow brightest  
   - Dimmer fragments can still be collected but require more attention/skill  
   - This simulates: we naturally notice what interests us most  

5. **Forgetting Fog Obstacles:**  
   - Gray fog clouds drift across lanes  
   - Cannot be avoided completely - will touch some  
   - When character runs through fog:  
     - Screen briefly becomes slightly hazy  
     - One collected fragment (if any) fades from collection bag  
     - Represents normal forgetting over time  
   - Not a "failure" - game text says: "Memory naturally forgets some things!"  

6. **Collection Choices:**  
   - Player can only collect fragments they actively run toward  
   - Path scrolls quickly - must make split-second decisions  
   - Can't collect everything (too many fragments in too many lanes)  
   - Must choose: "Which fragments matter to ME?"  
   - This simulates selective attention and encoding  

7. **Distance Markers:**  
   - Path has markers every 100 meters:  
     - "100m: Arrived at museum"  
     - "200m: Saw dinosaur bones"  
     - "300m: Ate lunch in park"  
     - "400m: Played on playground"  
     - "500m: Rode bus home"  
   - Fragments correspond to these events  

8. **Run Completion:**  
   - After 500 meters (approximately 90 seconds of running)  
   - Character crosses finish line  
   - "Memory Collection Complete!" appears  
   - Transition to results screen  

9. **Results Display - First Run:**  
   - Collection bag opens showing gathered fragments:  
     - Visual: [X] fragments (yellow orbs)  
     - Action: [X] fragments (green orbs)  
     - Social: [X] fragments (blue orbs)  
   - Each fragment tapped reveals a memory:  
     - Visual fragment: "Red dinosaur bones"  
     - Action fragment: "Running on playground"  
     - Social fragment: "Teacher's smile"  
   - Total collected: 12–18 fragments (out of ~30 available)  
   - Message: "This is what [Character name] remembered from the field trip!"  

---

#### PART 2: Second Run - Different Character
10. **New Perspective Prompt:**  
    - "Want to see what someone else remembered from the SAME field trip?"  
    - Two remaining characters shown  
    - "Run as [Different Character]" buttons  
    - Player selects second character  

11. **Same Lane, Different Collection:**  
    - Same Memory Lane layout (same fragments in same positions)  
    - But new character's strengths highlight different fragments:  
      - If first run was Maya (visual focus), second might be Diego (action focus)  
      - Diego's action fragments glow brightest now  
      - Same obstacles (fog) in same positions  
    - Player runs through identical path but likely collects different fragments  

12. **Second Run Results:**  
    - Different collection mix:  
      - More action fragments (if Diego)  
      - Fewer visual fragments  
      - Different memories revealed  
    - Example:  
      - Diego collected: "Climbing on dinosaur replica" (action)  
      - Maya collected: "Colorful museum walls" (visual)  
      - Both at same location, noticed different things!  

---

#### PART 3: Comparison & Discovery
13. **Side-by-Side Memory Comparison:**  
    - Both collection bags displayed together  
    - Venn diagram appears showing:  
      - SHARED memories: Both characters collected (overlap = 4–6 fragments)  
      - UNIQUE to Character 1: Only first character collected (6–8 fragments)  
      - UNIQUE to Character 2: Only second character collected (6–8 fragments)  
      - MISSED by both: Fragments neither collected (shown as gray silhouettes)  

14. **Interactive Exploration:**  
    - Player can tap any fragment to see:  
      - "Maya collected this: 'Blue sky'"  
      - "Diego didn't notice the sky - he was watching his friends play"  
    - Tap shared memories:  
      - "Both Maya and Diego remembered: 'The big T-Rex skeleton!'"  
      - "This stood out to both of them!"  
    - Tap missed memories:  
      - "Neither Maya nor Diego remembered what the bus driver looked like"  
      - "They were focused on other things. That's okay!"  

15. **Discovery Questions:**  
    - "Why did Maya and Diego remember different things?"  
    - Multiple choice (all validated):  
      - "They paid attention to different things" ✓  
      - "They care about different things" ✓  
      - "You can't remember everything" ✓  
    - Player selects answer(s)  
    - Feedback: "Exactly! Everyone's memory is selective. You notice what matters to YOU, and you can't collect everything. That's how memory works for everyone!"  

---

#### PART 4: Third Run (Optional Challenge)
16. **"Try to Remember Everything" Challenge:**  
    - "Want to try collecting ALL the fragments? It's really hard!"  
    - Player runs third time, attempting perfect collection  
    - Same lane, all fragments visible  
    - Challenge demonstrates: impossible to get everything  
      - Fragments in multiple lanes simultaneously  
      - Speed requires split-second choices  
      - Fog causes inevitable forgetting  
    - Even skilled players get maybe 20–25 of 30 fragments  

17. **Forgetting Is Normal:**  
    - Results show: "You collected [X] out of 30 possible fragments. That's great!"  
    - Missing fragments displayed: "These are the ones you missed or forgot"  
    - Message: "See? Even when you try really hard, you can't remember everything. Memory naturally stores some things and misses others. And that's perfectly okay! Your memory isn't broken - it's working exactly how it should."  

---

#### PART 5: Empathy Moment
18. **Friend Comparison:**  
    - "Imagine your friend ran down Memory Lane too. Would they collect the same fragments as you?"  
    - Hypothetical friend's collection shown (algorithmically different from player's)  
    - Same event, different fragments emphasized  
    - Question: "Is your friend's memory wrong?"  
    - Two options:  
      - "No - we all remember differently" ✓  
      - "Yes - only mine is right" ✗  
    - Correct answer feedback: "You understand! Different memories of the same event are all valid. Your friend noticed different things than you. That makes both memories real and true!"  

---

When you and your friend remember something differently, you're BOTH right - you each paid attention to different parts. Memory isn't about being perfect - it's about noticing what matters to YOU!"  

**Return Navigation:**
- "Run Again" button (replay with different character)  
- "Challenge Mode" button (try to collect everything)

### Continuity Note
This game completes Unit 4's arc through active, kinetic gameplay. Students began with memory as storage (Lesson 1), learned the encoding process (Lesson 2), practiced strategies (Lesson 3), and now experience memory's natural selectivity and variability through embodied play. The endless runner format makes memory's limitations feel natural, not frustrating—you can't collect everything because you're moving fast and making choices, just like real memory.

## How Lesson 4 Fits into the Full Learning Arc

Lesson 4 brings **Unit 4: How Memory Works** to completion by transforming understanding into perspective. Across this unit, students moved from learning **what memory does** (storage) to **how it works** (attention and encoding), to **how it can be strengthened** (strategies), and finally to **why it varies** (constructive and selective processes).  

The two home games—*Shattered Memories* and *Memory Lane Runner*—turn these insights into experience. Students see that even when two people share the same event, their memories differ naturally because of attention, interest, and perspective. Forgetting or remembering differently becomes redefined as **normal function, not failure**.  

By recognizing that memory is both personal and imperfect, children internalize empathy and self-compassion: differences in recall reflect diversity in noticing, not mistakes. This final lesson therefore transforms knowledge about memory into wisdom about minds—both their own and others’—closing the learning arc with psychological literacy that balances cognitive understanding and emotional insight.  

> 🧠 **Learning Arc Summary:** Storage → Formation → Strengthening → Perspective.  
> Through these stages, students learn that memory is not a fixed record but an active process shaped by attention, meaning, and individuality—building self-efficacy (“I can help my memory work better”) and mental resilience (“I can understand and accept how my mind works”).
