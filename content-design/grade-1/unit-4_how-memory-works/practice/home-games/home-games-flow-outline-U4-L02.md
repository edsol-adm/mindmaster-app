## Home Game 2A – Spotlight Memory Lab
> Jump to: [Setup](#setup) · [Play](#play) · [Scoring](#scoring) · [Win Condition](#win-condition) · [Continuity Note](#continuity-note)

### Learning Objective
Students will understand the three stages of memory (noticing/encoding, storing, retrieving) and recognize that paying attention is the crucial first step.

### Game File Name & Format
`hg-04.02-01.html` — Physics Puzzle Game

### Game Purpose
This game makes the encoding process visual and interactive. The spotlight represents attention, darkness represents ignored information, and the physics of "capturing" illuminated items demonstrates that attention is the gateway to memory storage.

### Estimated Play Time
8–10 minutes (5 levels × 1.5–2 minutes each)

---

### Setup
**Opening Screen:**
- Laboratory setting with cartoon scientist character (child in lab coat with goggles)
- Character explains: "Memory needs attention to work! Use your attention spotlight to notice things. What you light up, your memory can store!"
- Dark scene preview shown with one spotlight already illuminating a small area
- Controls shown: Drag spotlight with mouse/finger, tap to "capture" illuminated items
- "Start Lab Experiment!" button

---

### Play
**Step-by-step gameplay:**

#### LEVEL 1: Single Spotlight (Tutorial)
**Scene Setup:**
- Dark scene (80% shadowed) with various objects barely visible as silhouettes
- One controllable spotlight (circular bright area) appears
- At bottom: Empty "Memory Storage Box"
- Objects in scene: 5 simple items (ball, book, apple, hat, flower)

**Spotlight Mechanics:**
- Player drags spotlight around scene using mouse/finger
- Spotlight illuminates objects it passes over
- Illuminated objects become fully visible and colored
- Objects outside spotlight remain dark/gray silhouettes

**Attention & Encoding:**
- When spotlight stays on an object for 2 seconds, object begins to glow
- Glowing = "being encoded" (attention is working!)
- Visual effect: Light particles flow from object toward storage box
- After 2 seconds, object "locks" with sparkle effect

**Storage:**
- Tap/click locked (encoded) object to "store" it
- Object flies down to storage box with satisfying physics arc
- Counter updates: "Stored: 1/5"
- Stored object appears as icon in box

**Level Goal:**
- Notice (illuminate) and store all 5 objects
- If spotlight moves away before 2-second encoding, progress resets (gentle visual fade-back)
- Text appears: "Attention has to stay focused to encode memories!"

#### LEVEL 2: Distraction Challenge
**Added Complexity:**
- Same dark scene, but now "distraction items" appear
- Distraction items (animated) try to pull spotlight away:
  - Bouncing ball crosses screen
  - Flashing light appears in corner
  - Moving shapes drift by
- If spotlight follows distraction, encoding of target item pauses
- Visual feedback: "Your attention moved! The memory encoding stopped."

**Learning Goal:**
- Player must resist distractions, keep spotlight steady on target objects
- Successfully ignoring distractions rewards bonus points
- Demonstrates: sustained attention = stronger encoding

#### LEVEL 3: Multiple Spotlights
**Advanced Mechanics:**
- Scene now has 8 objects to encode
- Player controls TWO spotlights simultaneously (one with each hand on tablet, or rapid switching)
- Can encode two objects at once if both spotlights maintained
- Teaches: attention can be divided, but it's harder

**Physics Challenge:**
- Some objects are behind others (layered)
- Must illuminate foreground object first, then move spotlight to reach background
- Introduces spatial reasoning + attention

#### LEVEL 4: Moving Objects
**Dynamic Scene:**
- Objects slowly drift across dark scene
- Spotlight must track moving object for 2 seconds to encode
- Simulates: paying attention to dynamic real-world events
- Hardest level: requires sustained focus on moving targets

#### FINAL LEVEL: Free Play Lab
**Experiment Mode:**
- Complex scene with 12 objects, mix of stationary and moving
- Player chooses which objects to attend to
- No right or wrong — experience how attention shapes what gets stored
- After completion, game shows:
  "You stored these 7 objects! Someone else might store different ones. Attention determines what memory keeps."

### Continuity Note
This game directly models the encoding stage (notice/attention) from Lesson 2's three-stage model. The physics-based spotlight mechanic makes abstract attention concrete and controllable. This prepares students for Lesson 3, where they'll learn specific strategies to "aim their spotlight" more effectively.

## Home Game 2B – Memory Formation Simulator
> Jump to: [Setup](#setup-1) · [Play](#play-1) · [Scoring](#scoring-1) · [Win Condition](#win-condition-1) · [Continuity Note](#continuity-note-1)

### Learning Objective
Students will demonstrate that paying attention during the "noticing" phase determines how well information is stored and retrieved later.

### Game File Name & Format
`hg-04.02-02.html` — Simulation / Sandbox Game

### Game Purpose
This game lets students experiment with the cause-effect relationship between attention and memory encoding. By directly controlling variables and seeing immediate results, students discover the scientific principle: strong attention → strong encoding → successful retrieval.

### Estimated Play Time
9–10 minutes (5 experiments × ~2 minutes each)

---

### Setup
**Opening Screen:**
- Split-screen interface:
  - Left side: Control panel with sliders and buttons
  - Right side: Animated brain with visual memory formation display
- Cartoon scientist character appears: "Welcome to the Memory Formation Simulator! You control how memory works. Let's experiment!"
- Three large sliders visible:
  - ATTENTION LEVEL (low to high)
  - DISTRACTION (none to lots)
  - TIME FOCUSING (short to long)
- "Run Experiment" button glows

---

### Play
**Step-by-step gameplay:**

#### EXPERIMENT 1: Attention Level Test
**Setup Phase:**
- Scenario appears in speech bubble: "You're trying to remember your friend's phone number: 555-1234"
- Player adjusts ATTENTION LEVEL slider (Low, Medium, High)
- Other variables locked neutral

**Formation Phase:**
- Player clicks "Run Experiment"
- Animated brain shows:
  - Low attention → Small, dim glow in memory area, weak connections forming
  - Medium attention → Moderate glow, some connections
  - High attention → Bright, strong glow, many neural connections forming rapidly
- Visual: Phone number "555-1234" appears in brain, brightness/clarity matches attention level
- Formation takes 5 seconds with real-time visual feedback

**Storage Display:**
- After formation, memory moves into "storage vault" in brain illustration
- Storage strength shown as: Weak (faded), Medium (clear), Strong (bright + glowing)
- Text feedback: "Attention level: [HIGH]. Memory strength: [STRONG]"

**Retrieval Test:**
- Screen transitions to retrieval challenge
- "A few moments later... Can you remember the phone number?"
- Player must tap correct numbers from a keypad
- Result based on attention used:
  - Low attention: Only remembers 2–3 digits correctly (555-12??)
  - Medium attention: Remembers 4–5 digits (555-123?)
  - High attention: Remembers all 6 digits (555-1234)
- Discovery message:
  "You discovered: Higher attention = stronger memory formation = better recall!"
- Data logged in "Lab Notebook"

#### EXPERIMENT 2: Distraction Test
**New Scenario:**
- "You're learning a new word: 'magnificent' means very beautiful"
- Player adjusts DISTRACTION slider:
  - None (quiet room)
  - Some (background noise)
  - Lots (TV on, people talking, phone buzzing)
- Attention locked at "Medium"
- Animated brain shows formation pausing/restarting when distractions appear
- Retrieval: "What does 'magnificent' mean?" (Very beautiful / Very big / Very loud)
- Results logged: "More distractions = weaker encoding"

#### EXPERIMENT 3: Time Duration Test
**Time Variable:**
- "You're trying to remember this pattern: △○□"
- Player adjusts TIME FOCUSING slider:
  - Quick glance (2 seconds)
  - Normal look (5 seconds)
  - Careful study (10 seconds)
- Distraction locked at "None," Attention at "High"
- Longer focus time = deeper encoding, more connections formed
- Retrieval: "Draw the pattern you saw" — tap three shapes in correct order
- Short time → often incorrect order
- Long time → correct pattern recalled

#### EXPERIMENT 4: Combined Variables (Sandbox Mode)
**Free Experimentation:**
- "Now YOU design the experiment!"
- All three sliders unlocked
- Scenarios presented randomly (colors, names, facts, sequences)
- Player predicts outcome before running experiment: "Will this create a strong or weak memory?"
- After retrieval test, prediction compared to result
- Builds hypothesis-testing skills

#### EXPERIMENT 5: Real-World Application
**Scenario Choices:**
- Four common situations presented:
  - Studying for a test (low distraction, high attention, long time = strong memory)
  - Watching TV while doing homework (high distraction = weak memory)
  - Quickly glancing at directions (short time = weak memory)
  - Carefully reading a story (high attention, long time = strong memory)
- Player sets variables to match each scenario
- Game validates: "Yes! That's how memory works in real life!"

### Continuity Note
This simulation game makes Lesson 2's three-stage model scientifically testable. By manipulating variables and observing outcomes, students internalize the causal mechanisms of encoding. This experimental understanding sets up Lesson 3 perfectly: now that they know what affects memory formation, they're ready to learn strategies to optimize those variables.

## How Lesson 2 Fits into the Full Learning Arc
Lesson 2 deepens students’ understanding of memory by showing **how memories are actually made**. Building on Lesson 1’s metaphor of the “memory vault,” this lesson reveals the **process** that determines what goes inside it: attention (noticing), storage, and retrieval. Both home games turn this invisible cognitive process into visible cause-and-effect systems—first through *Spotlight Memory Lab*, where focus becomes a literal tool for encoding, and then through *Memory Formation Simulator*, where children experiment with attention, time, and distraction as scientific variables shaping memory strength.

- **Lesson 1:** Introduced memory as the system that stores information.
- **Lesson 2 (this document):** Explains the *mechanism* of how information enters that system—showing attention as the gateway to encoding.
- **Lesson 3:** Expands this understanding by teaching strategies to strengthen memory once formed (repetition, association, storytelling, visualization).
- **Lesson 4:** Brings perspective, showing that differences and forgetfulness are natural parts of how memory functions.

> 🧠 **Learning Arc Summary:** System → Process → Strategies → Perspective.  
> Through these stages, children shift from seeing memory as a mysterious “box” to recognizing it as a *trainable process* they can observe, influence, and improve—building not only understanding but confidence in their own learning power.
