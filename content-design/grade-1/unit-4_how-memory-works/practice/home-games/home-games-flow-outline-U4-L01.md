> Jump to: [Setup](#setup) · [Play](#play) · [Scoring](#scoring) · [Win Condition](#win-condition) · [Continuity Note](#continuity-note)

### Learning Objective
Students will understand that memory is a mental tool that stores and retrieves different types of information (names, experiences, skills, facts) from past experiences.

### Game File Name & Format
`hg-04.01-01.html` — Platformer / Action Game

### Game Purpose
This game makes memory's storage function tangible through spatial exploration. By physically navigating different "storage rooms" (each representing a category: names, skills, experiences, facts), students internalize that memory organizes and stores diverse information types.

### Estimated Play Time
7–10 minutes (depending on player skill)

---

### Setup
**Opening Screen:**
- Cartoon character "Memory Keeper" (friendly robot with glowing chest compartment) appears.
- Character stands at entrance to a colorful vault with four visible doors, each glowing a different color:  
  - **BLUE door:** Names Room (face icons floating above)  
  - **GREEN door:** Skills Room (hand/tool icons)  
  - **YELLOW door:** Experiences Room (camera/star icons)  
  - **RED door:** Facts Room (book/lightbulb icons)
- Simple controls shown: Arrow keys or swipe to move, Space/tap to jump.  
- “Enter the Memory Vault!” button pulses.

---

### Play
**Step-by-step gameplay:**

#### WORLD 1: Names Room (Blue)
**Room Entry:**
- Character enters blue-tinted room with floating platforms.  
- Platforms arranged at different heights requiring jumps.  
- Memory items appear as glowing orbs with icons: “Mom,” “Teacher,” “Best Friend,” “Pet.”  
- Some platforms move slowly left/right.  

**Navigation:**
- Player uses arrow keys/swipe to move character left or right.  
- Tap/Space to jump between platforms.  
- Must time jumps to reach higher platforms.  
- Collect 8 name-memory orbs scattered throughout room.  

**Obstacles:**
- “Distraction clouds” float slowly—touching them makes screen briefly fuzzy (doesn’t hurt, just visual effect).  
- Gaps between platforms require careful jumping.  
- Moving platforms require timing.  

**Collection:**
- Each collected orb plays gentle chime.  
- Orb stores in character’s chest compartment (visible glow).  
- Counter shows: “Names: 5/8.”  

**Room Completion:**
- After collecting all 8, exit door appears glowing.  
- Character exits to vault hub.  

#### WORLD 2–4: Same Structure, Different Themes
**Skills Room (Green):**
- Platforms shaped like tools/objects.  
- Collect skill memories: “Tying shoes,” “Riding bike,” “Counting,” “Drawing.”  
- Slightly more challenging platform spacing.  

**Experiences Room (Yellow):**
- Platforms made of photo frames and memory bubbles.  
- Collect experience memories: “Birthday,” “Beach trip,” “First day school,” “Park visit.”  
- Some platforms disappear/reappear (testing timing).  

**Facts Room (Red):**
- Platforms shaped like books and question marks.  
- Collect fact memories: “Sky is blue,” “Dogs bark,” “Ice melts,” “Plants grow.”  
- Most challenging platform layout.  

---

### Final Sequence
**Vault Hub Return:**
- All four doors now glow brightly (completed).  
- Central platform rises showing all collected memories organized in four categories.  
- Character’s chest compartment opens revealing all stored memories glowing inside.  

**Discovery Moment:**
- Brief animation shows memories flowing from each room into organized sections.  
- Text appears: “You discovered how memory stores different types of information! Each type has its own place in your memory vault.”  

---

### Scoring
**Collection-Based Scoring:**
- 1 memory gem per collected memory orb (32 total across 4 rooms).  
- Time bonus: Complete each room under 2 minutes = 3 bonus gems per room (12 possible).  
- Perfect collection: Collect all memories in a room without touching distractions = 2 bonus gems per room (8 possible).  
- **Maximum: 52 gems total.**

**Badge System:**  
- Bronze: 20–30 gems  
- Silver: 31–42 gems  
- Gold: 43–52 gems  

Gems displayed as glowing crystals in top-right corner with running total.

---

### Win Condition
Game completes when all four rooms are cleared and player returns to vault hub.  
Final screen shows:
- Character celebrating with all memory compartments glowing.  
- Total gems earned and badge level achieved.  
- Summary: “You explored the Memory Vault! You collected [X] names, [X] skills, [X] experiences, and [X] facts. Memory stores all these different types of information!”  

**Return Navigation:**
- “Explore Again” button (replay game)  
- “Return to Home Games” button (links to `hg-04.01.html`)  
- “Return to Lesson” button (links to `lesson-04.01.html`)

### Continuity Note
This game establishes memory as an organized storage system with distinct categories. The spatial/physical metaphor of navigating rooms makes abstract concepts concrete. This foundation prepares students for Lesson 2, where they'll learn the process of how information enters these storage rooms (encoding → storage → retrieval).

## Home Game 1B – Memory Detective – Hidden Treasures
> Jump to: [Setup](#setup-1) · [Play](#play-1) · [Scoring](#scoring-1) · [Win Condition](#win-condition-1) · [Continuity Note](#continuity-note-1)

### Learning Objective
Students will demonstrate understanding that everyone has memory working for them, but people may remember different things or in different ways.

### Game File Name & Format
`hg-04.01-02.html` — Hidden Object / Scene Explorer

### Game Purpose
This game demonstrates that memory notices and stores different things based on what captures attention. By searching for specific memory types in complex scenes, students experience how selective attention determines what memory stores—foreshadowing that different people store different memories.

### Estimated Play Time
8–10 minutes (3 scenes × 2–3 minutes each + bonuses)

---

### Setup
**Opening Screen:**
- Cartoon detective character (child with magnifying glass and detective hat) appears.  
- Character says: “Memory is like a treasure hunt! Different memories are hidden all around us. Can you find them all?”  
- Three scene buttons appear, each showing a preview:  
  - **SCENE 1:** Busy Playground  
  - **SCENE 2:** Classroom  
  - **SCENE 3:** Family Kitchen  
- “Start Searching!” button glows.  
- Magnifying glass cursor appears when hovering.

---

### Play
**Step-by-step gameplay:**

#### SCENE 1: Busy Playground
**Scene Display:**
- Richly detailed cartoon playground scene fills screen.  
- 15–20 visible elements: children playing, swings, slide, trees, birds, toys, bench, adult, flowers, clouds, etc.  
- Everything is interactive (can be tapped).  
- At bottom: Four collection boxes labeled NAMES, SKILLS, EXPERIENCES, FACTS.  

**Hidden Memory Hunt:**
- Magnifying glass cursor enlarges when hovering over elements.  
- Player taps elements to “discover” what type of memory they represent.  
- Example taps:  
  - Tap child → “This is Sarah! (NAME memory)” → Sarah’s icon flies to NAMES box.  
  - Tap swing → “Swinging is a SKILL!” → Icon flies to SKILLS box.  
  - Tap adult watching → “Remembering the teacher here is an EXPERIENCE” → Flies to EXPERIENCES box.  
  - Tap bird → “Birds fly! That’s a FACT” → Flies to FACTS box.  

**Discovery Feedback:**
- Each correct discovery plays gentle sparkle sound.  
- Tapped item briefly glows and shimmers.  
- Collection box counter updates (e.g., “Names: 3/5”).  
- Some items are “neutral” (decorative only)—tapping gives gentle feedback: “Just a decoration!”  

**Target Collection:**
- Goal: Find specific number of each type:  
  - 5 Name memories  
  - 4 Skill memories  
  - 4 Experience memories  
  - 3 Fact memories  
- Progress bars show collection status for each category.  

**Hint System:**
- After 1 minute, “Need a hint?” button appears.  
- Clicking highlights one undiscovered memory with gentle pulse.  
- Unlimited hints available (no penalty).  

#### SCENE 2: Classroom
**New Environment:**  
- Different detailed scene with new hidden memories.  
- Same mechanics but different distribution:  
  - More fact memories (educational setting).  
  - Different skill memories (writing, counting).  
  - Slightly harder: memories less obvious.  

#### SCENE 3: Family Kitchen
**Final Challenge:**  
- Most complex scene.  
- Memories overlap conceptually (e.g., “cooking” could be skill OR experience).  
- Game accepts either interpretation with positive feedback:  
  “Yes! Cooking can be both a SKILL and an EXPERIENCE. You’re thinking like a memory scientist!”  

**Bonus Round:**  
- **Speed Challenge (Optional):**  
  - Replay any scene with 90-second timer.  
  - See how many memories can be collected quickly.  
  - Builds fluency and recognition speed.  

---

### Scoring
**Discovery-Based Scoring:**
- 2 stars per correctly identified memory (16 memories per scene = 32 stars per scene).  
- Bonus stars:  
  - Complete scene without hints: +5 stars.  
  - Find all memories in a scene: +10 stars.  
  - Speed bonus (under 2 minutes): +5 stars.  
- **Maximum per scene:** 52 stars.  
- **Total maximum (3 scenes):** 156 stars.  

**Completion Levels:**  
- Novice Detective: 50–90 stars

- Master Detective: 131–156 stars  

Stars displayed as detective badges filling up a badge collection board.

---

### Win Condition
Game completes after all three scenes are explored and target memories collected.  
Final screen shows:
- Detective character with magnifying glass examining collection boxes.  
- All discovered memories organized by category.  
- Detective rank achieved.  
- Message: “You discovered memories hidden all around! Memory stores what YOU notice. Different people might find different memories in the same place—and that’s perfectly okay!”  

**Return Navigation:**
- “Search Again” button (replay scenes).  
- “Return to Home Games” button (links to `hg-04.01.html`).  
- “Return to Lesson” button (links to `lesson-04.01.html`).

### Continuity Note
This game reinforces that memory storage depends on what you notice, introducing the variability concept that will be central to Lesson 4. The hidden object format makes “noticing” an active, intentional process, preparing students for Lesson 2’s focus on attention as the gateway to memory formation.

## How Lesson 1 Fits into the Full Learning Arc

Lesson 1 introduces **memory as the mind’s storage system**—a structured tool that collects and retrieves information from our experiences. The two home games turn this abstract concept into tangible experiences: in *Memory Vault Explorer*, children explore the **organization** of memory (how different information types are stored), while in *Memory Detective*, they experience **variability** in what gets remembered depending on what’s noticed.  

- **Lesson 1 (this document):** Builds understanding of memory as an organized, observable system with distinct information types.  
- **Lesson 2:** Explores *how* memories are formed—showing the process of noticing, storing, and retrieving.  
- **Lesson 3:** Strengthens self-efficacy through memory improvement strategies such as repetition, association, storytelling, and visualization.  
- **Lesson 4:** Expands perspective to include memory’s differences and imperfections—normalizing variation and forgetfulness as part of how memory works.  

> 🧠 **Learning Arc Summary:** Structure → Process → Strengthening → Perspective.  
> Through these stages, children come to see memory not as magic but as a skillful system they can understand, improve, and appreciate—building both cognitive insight and confidence in their own learning abilities.
