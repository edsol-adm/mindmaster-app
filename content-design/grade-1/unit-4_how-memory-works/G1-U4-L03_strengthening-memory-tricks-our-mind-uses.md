# Lesson 3: Strengthening Memory — Tricks Our Mind Uses

## Lesson Objective
Students will learn and apply at least three memory strategies (repetition, association, storytelling, visualization) and understand that memory is improvable—they can actively help their memory work better.

---

## Connection to Unit Arc
Lessons 1–2 explained what memory is and how it works. Lesson 3 shifts to agency: "I can do something to strengthen my memory." This builds self-efficacy and positions memory as a skill, not just a function. Lesson 4 will then contextualize these strategies within the reality that memory is imperfect and variable—strategies help, but forgetting is still normal.

## Warm-Up (5 minutes)

**Activity: "Can Memory Get Stronger?"**

Ask:  
"If you practice riding a bike, do you get better? Your muscles get stronger, right? What about your memory? Can it get stronger with practice?"

Take responses. Then introduce:  
"Today, we're going to learn four tricks that make memory stronger. We can practice these tricks, and when we do, our memory works better. You're not stuck with your memory as it is—you can actually help it get stronger!"

**Pedagogy note:** This warm-up frames memory as trainable and positions the student as an agent in their own cognitive development.

## Explore + Practice (30 minutes)

### Explore A: Introduction to Memory Strategies (5 minutes)
**Materials:** Hard copy – four-part chart or poster

Introduce four memory strategies. Display a chart with images or simple labels:

- **REPETITION:** Saying something over and over. "Repeat it, repeat it, repeat it—your brain stores it better."  
- **ASSOCIATION:** Linking something new to something you already know. "I remember my new friend's name is Ruby because she has a ruby-red backpack."  
- **STORYTELLING:** Turning a list into a story so it sticks. "The dog ate the pizza in the park"—instead of just: dog, pizza, park.  
- **VISUALIZATION:** Making a mental picture. "Picture a giant pizza in your bedroom—silly! And now you'll remember."

Explain:  
"These are like vitamins for your memory. When you use them, your memory gets stronger."

**Pedagogy note:** Naming and simplifying these strategies makes them concrete and actionable. Students see these are tools they can use.

### Practice A: Psychology Experiment – "Memory Strategies Showdown" (8 minutes)

**Experiment Format:** Comparison Test Using MindMaster App  

This experiment compares recall when using vs. not using a memory strategy, making the science visible.

**Setup:**  
Students will remember two lists: one without a strategy, one with a strategy (storytelling).

**MindMaster Game Flow (Experiment embedded in app):**
- **Round 1:** Students see a list of 5 random words (apple, shoe, table, cloud, fish) on screen for 20 seconds.  
- **Round 2:** Students see a different list of 5 words (bike, flower, cat, rock, door) told as a silly story: "A bike rode past a flower where a cat sat on a rock next to a door."  

**Play:**
- **Round 1 (No Strategy):** Words appear; students memorize without strategy. After 20 seconds, words disappear. Students use clickers (buttons 1–5) to answer: "Which word was on the list?" (3 options per question; 5 questions total). Score is tracked.  
- **Round 2 (With Story):** Story is read twice (or shown as short animation). Students use clickers to answer similar multiple-choice questions about the story words. Score is tracked.  
- **Scoring:** Points awarded for correct answers in each round. Round scores compared on screen.  
- **Win Condition:** Students see which round had higher recall. Discussion: "The story made it easier! Storytelling is a memory trick."

**Pedagogy note:** By embedding the experiment in MindMaster, data is instant and visible. Students see that the strategy worked—powerful evidence for self-efficacy.

### Practice B: Hands-On Strategy Practice (8 minutes)
**Materials:** Hard copy – task cards or worksheet

Students practice each strategy hands-on. Split into four mini-stations or do sequentially. Each task takes 1–2 minutes.

- **Station 1 – Repetition:** Give students a made-up phone number: 7-2-4-1-5-9. Ask them to say it aloud together 10 times. Then test: "Who can remember it?" Most will.  
  **Debrief:** "Repetition gave your brain many chances to notice and store it."

- **Station 2 – Association:** Give students a new vocabulary word, e.g., "tenacious means not giving up." Link it: "Tenacious sounds like 'ten-ay-shus'—imagine someone who tries ten times. That's tenacious!" Ask them to make their own association.  
  **Debrief:** "Linking to what you know makes memory stick."

- **Station 3 – Storytelling:** Give students a list of 4 items: pencil, sandwich, dog, cloud. Ask them to make up a silly story connecting them, e.g., "The dog ate my sandwich, then drew a pencil picture of a cloud." Then test: "What items did we story-tell?"  
  **Debrief:** "Stories are like memory glue."

- **Station 4 – Visualization:** Ask students to imagine a giant purple banana in their classroom. Make it silly and vivid. "Where would it sit? Is it wearing a hat?" Then test: "What did we visualize?"  
  **Debrief:** "Funny mental pictures stick in memory."

**Pedagogy note:** Active practice with immediate feedback shows students that they can use these strategies successfully. This is the core of self-efficacy building.

## Reflection (5 minutes)

**Activity:** "My Memory Trick" (MindMaster Reflection)

Students answer reflective prompts on MindMaster, using clickers.

**MindMaster Reflection Flow:**
- **Prompt 1:** "Which memory strategy did you find easiest to use?"  
  (1) Repetition, (2) Association, (3) Storytelling, (4) Visualization  
- **Prompt 2:** "Do you think memory can get stronger with practice?"  
  (1) Yes, definitely. (2) Maybe. (3) Not sure.  
- **Prompt 3:** "Which strategy will you try at home?"  
  (1) Repetition, (2) Association, (3) Storytelling, (4) Visualization  

Display class responses as a simple chart (e.g., “Most of us chose Storytelling!”).  
**Debrief (spoken):** “Look at all the strategies you're using. Your memory is getting stronger because you're learning how to help it!”

**Pedagogy note:** This reflection uses MindMaster to gather data and make learning visible to the class. It also preps the next lesson by affirming that memory strategies work.

## Home Prep (5 minutes)

**Teacher Guidance for At-Home MindMaster Use**

Explain:  
"Tonight, you'll play a game on MindMaster called 'Memory Tricks.' It's like the strategies we practiced today. At home, you can try one strategy yourself: pick a memory trick (repetition, association, storytelling, or visualization) and use it to remember something. Tell your family which trick you used and why it worked."

Send home a reference card:
> **The Four Memory Tricks:**  
> Repetition (say it again)  
> Association (link to what you know)  
> Storytelling (make a story)  
> Visualization (make a silly picture)  
>
> **Challenge:** Use one trick to remember your homework, your friend's favorite color, or a new word. Tell someone about it!
