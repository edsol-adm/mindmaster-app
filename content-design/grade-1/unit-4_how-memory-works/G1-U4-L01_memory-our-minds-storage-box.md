# Lesson 1: Memory – Our Mind's Storage Box

## Lesson Objective
Students will understand that memory is a mental tool that stores and retrieves information from past experiences, and that everyone's memory works even if people remember different things.

---

## Connection to Unit Arc
This is the foundation lesson of the unit. It introduces memory as a concrete, observable function of the mind rather than something mysterious. Lesson 2 will build on this by explaining how memories form, so students need to first understand what memory is and why it matters in daily life.

## Warm-Up (5 minutes)

**Activity: "What Do You Remember?"**

Gather students in a circle. Ask: "This morning, you came to school. Without looking at anything, who can tell me one thing you remember from this morning?" Take 3–4 responses (breakfast, getting dressed, the walk, etc.).

Then ask: "How did you know to remember that? Your brain must have kept that information, right? That's called memory—it's your mind's storage box. Today, we're going to explore what memory does and why everyone has one."

**Pedagogy note:** This warm-up anchors memory in lived experience, establishing that students already use memory and can observe it in themselves. It primes curiosity.

## Explore + Practice (30 minutes)

### Explore A: What Is Memory? (8 minutes)
**Materials:** Hard copy – large sheet of paper, markers  

Display a large sheet labeled "Our Memory Storage Box" (or draw it on whiteboard). Ask students: "If your memory is like a storage box in your mind, what kinds of things does it store?"

Facilitate a short discussion. Prompt with examples: "Can you remember a song? A friend's name? How to button your coat? A story I told you yesterday?"

Record student responses in categories on the sheet:
- Names and faces  
- Skills (how to do things)  
- Stories and facts  
- Feelings and experiences  

**Pedagogy note:** This co-constructed chart becomes a visual anchor. Students see that memory is multifaceted and relevant to their lives. It moves memory from abstract to observable and named.

### Psychology Video (2 minutes)

**Video:** "How Does Your Memory Work?" by TED-Ed  
**Link:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8kcristianYI  

**Note:** This video is indicative only. In the full MindMaster version, a modified or copyright-free video will be produced or featured to illustrate the same concept.

**Purpose:** Reinforces the storage metaphor using clear, age-appropriate visuals. Aligns memory function with the "storage box" language students just used.  
**Timing:** Play after Explore A to validate and extend student thinking.

### Practice A: Psychology Experiment – "What Do You Remember?" (10 minutes)

**In-class Test (no MindMaster)**  

This is a short observation experiment to show that everyone remembers, but people may remember different things.

**Setup:**
- Show students a picture (a busy scene with multiple objects—a park, a classroom, a kitchen). Display it for 30 seconds only. (Source: Use a free image from Pixabay or draw a simple scene with 8–10 items.)  
- Remove the picture.  
- Ask each student to write or draw one thing they remember from the picture.  
- Collect responses.  

**Step-by-step:**
1. Display the picture for exactly 30 seconds. Say: "Look carefully. Your memory is storing what you see."  
2. Hide the picture.  
3. Ask each student to draw or write one thing they remember.  
4. Collect the drawings/writings.  
5. Discuss: "Look at what everyone remembered. Did we all remember the same thing? No! That's because memory stores what we noticed, and we all notice different things. But everyone's memory worked—it stored and brought back information."  

**Pedagogy note:** This concrete, hands-on experiment shows that memory is real and working in the room right now. It normalizes variability in memory (foreshadowing Lesson 4) while affirming that all students have a functioning memory.

### Practice B: MindMaster In-Class Game (10 minutes)

**Game Format:** Matching Pairs (Memory Flip Game)  
**Game Title:** "Memory Storage Box – Find the Pairs"  

**Game Flow:**
- **Setup:** 8 pairs of cards appear face-down on screen (16 cards total). Pairs represent: name/face, skill/example, fact/category, experience/location.  
  E.g., "My friend's name" pairs with a face; "Tying my shoes" pairs with a shoe icon.  
- **Play:** Students use clickers to select card positions (clicker buttons 1–8 represent grid positions). When a student selects a position, the card flips. If they match, the pair stays face-up and the student scores a point. If not, cards flip back down.  
- **Scoring:** 1 point per correct match. Teacher tracks total team score (whole class plays collaboratively).  
- **Win Condition:** All 8 pairs matched = class "wins." Celebrate: "Your memories are getting stronger—you remembered where things were stored!"  

**Relation to Lesson:** This game reinforces that memory stores different kinds of information (names, skills, experiences, facts) and that memory retrieval is about bringing information back from storage. The matching mechanic models the retrieval process.

**Pedagogy note:** The game is playful but grounded in science. Every match is a model of successful memory retrieval.

## Reflection (5 minutes)

**Activity:** "My Memory Works" (Hard Copy)

Hand out a simple reflection sheet with prompts:
- "One thing I remember my memory stores is ______."  
- "I know my memory works because ______."  

Students draw or write 1–2 responses. Teacher circulates, reads aloud a few examples. Affirm: "Exactly—your memory is real, it's working right now, and it helps you every day."

---

## Home Prep (5 minutes)

**Teacher Guidance for At-Home MindMaster Use**

Explain to students: "Tonight, your family can play a memory game on MindMaster at home. You'll be the expert! You can show them how memory works."

Send home simple written instructions:
- "Play 'Memory Storage Box – Find the Pairs' with a family member or on your own."  
- "After you play, talk: What did your memory store to help you win?"  

This preps families for engagement and positions the student as a "memory scientist."

## Digital Outputs for Lesson 1

### Psychology Video
**Title:** How does your memory work?  
**Link:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8kirstianYI  
**Duration:** ~2 minutes  
**Note:** This video is indicative only. In the full MindMaster version, a modified or copyright-free video will be produced or featured to illustrate the same concept.  
**Why this video:** Clear metaphors and visuals explaining memory as a system (input, storage, retrieval). Age-appropriate.
