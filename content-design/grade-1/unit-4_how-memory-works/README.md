# Grade 1 · Unit 4 — How Memory Works

**Purpose**  
This unit introduces students to **memory as the mind’s storage and retrieval system** — a mental tool that connects the past with the present.  
Through exploration, guided experiments, and playful practice, students discover that memory is an **active process**, not just something that “happens.” They learn that:

- Memory **collects, keeps, and retrieves** information from experiences.  
- It works through **three stages** — noticing/encoding, storing, and retrieving.  
- Attention is the **first step** in forming strong memories.  
- Memory can be **strengthened with strategies** like repetition, association, storytelling, and visualization.  
- Forgetting or remembering differently is **normal**, showing how individual minds notice and rebuild experiences in unique ways.  

By seeing memory as a trainable system rather than a fixed ability, children develop curiosity, agency, and confidence: *“I can help my memory work better.”*

**Theory of Change**  
> **Knowledge** — Students learn that memory is the mind’s system for storing and bringing back information, gaining metacognitive awareness of how remembering and forgetting happen in daily life.  
> **→ Self-efficacy** — Students gain confidence through mastery experiences that memory can be improved by effort and strategy use, strengthening their belief in their ability to regulate how they learn and remember. 
> **→ Mental resilience** — Students normalise forgetting and memory differences as part of how all minds work, replacing frustration with adaptability and empathy.  

This builds the foundation for reflective learning and self-management: students see their minds as systems they can observe, guide, and improve.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this unit, students will be able to:

1. **Identify** memory as the mind’s tool for collecting, keeping, and bringing back information.  
2. **Describe** the three stages of memory — noticing/encoding, storing, and retrieving — using concrete examples.  
3. **Demonstrate** that paying attention strengthens memory by comparing focus vs. distraction.  
4. **Apply** memory strategies such as repetition, association, storytelling, and visualization.  
5. **Recognize** that forgetting or remembering differently is normal and reflects how minds work differently.

## Lesson Sequence
1. **L01 — Memory: Our Mind’s Storage Box**  
   Understanding memory as a reliable mental tool that stores and retrieves information from experiences.  

2. **L02 — Making Memories: How We Remember Things**  
   Exploring the three stages of memory — noticing, storing, and retrieving — and how attention starts the process.  

3. **L03 — Strengthening Memory: Tricks Our Mind Uses**  
   Discovering simple strategies to improve memory strength and accuracy through repetition, association, storytelling, and visualization.  

4. **L04 — Memories Are Different: And That’s Okay**  
   Realizing that memory is constructive, not perfect — people remember differently, and forgetting is part of how memory works.

## Digital & Interactive Components (MindMaster)
- **Psychology Experiments** – Interactive tests and comparisons that make memory visible (e.g., Focused vs. Distracted, Memory Strategies Showdown).  
- **MindMaster Games** – Matching, sequencing, and strategy-based games that simulate memory functions.  
- **Quizzes** – True/False and scenario-based activities to reinforce the three stages of memory and how strategies help.  
- **Reflections** – Clicker-based self-observation tools encouraging awareness of personal recall and learning habits.  
- **Teacher Dashboard** – Displays experiment results, classroom averages, and progress across the unit for pilot monitoring.

## Connection to Curriculum Arc
Unit 4 follows **Unit 3: Basics of Attention and Focus**.  
Where attention explained *how the mind selects what to notice*, memory now shows *how the mind stores and retrieves what it notices*.  
Together, they complete the second major phase of MindMaster’s curriculum: **“How the Mind Learns.”**

Through this unit, students develop:
- **Cognitive agency** — understanding they can improve memory performance through practice.  
- **Empathy and perspective-taking** — recognizing that differences in memory are normal.  
- **Resilience** — accepting that forgetting is natural and manageable.

This foundation prepares students for the next cognitive domains in Grade 1: **Imagination** and **Emotion Regulation**, continuing the journey toward full psychology literacy.
