---

### Continuity Note
This game brings Lesson 4's core message to life through narrative exploration: while all humans share feelings (Lesson 1's foundation), the ways we express them vary by culture, family, and individual personality. By encountering diverse expressions in respectful, story-based contexts, children develop both empathy and scientific observation—understanding that expressions are culturally shaped while feelings themselves are biologically universal. This completes the unit arc, showing feelings as information (L1), embodied experiences (L2), temporary states (L3), and universally human yet uniquely expressed (L4).

## Home Game 4B – Feelings Detective Agency
> Jump to: [Setup](#setup-1) · [Play](#play-1) · [Scoring](#scoring-1) · [Win Condition](#win-condition-1) · [Continuity Note](#continuity-note-1)

### Learning Objective
Students will demonstrate empathy by acknowledging that different expressions are valid, apply curiosity by asking "What might that person be feeling?" rather than assuming, and solidify understanding that feelings are universal while expressions vary.

### Game File Name & Format
`hg-06.04-02.html` — Life Simulation (from Generic: Simulation Games)

### Game Purpose
Children run a "Feelings Detective Agency" where they help characters understand each other's feelings by investigating behaviors, asking questions, and making observations—rather than jumping to assumptions. This builds practical empathy skills and reinforces that observable behavior (expression) doesn't always reveal internal experience (feeling).

---

### Play

#### Phase 1: Training Case (Minutes 1–2)

**Step 1: First Case Arrives**  
Phone rings: "We have a case! Please help!"  
Case file appears: "Case 1: The Quiet Kid"  
Situation: "Teacher reports: 'Jamie sits alone at lunch every day. Other kids think Jamie is sad and unfriendly.'"  
Your task: "Find out what Jamie is really feeling!"  

**Step 2: Investigation Options**  
Three detective approaches appear:  
- Option A: "Tell Jamie they should smile more so people know they're happy" ❌  
- Option B: "Observe Jamie carefully, then ask curious questions" ✓  
- Option C: "Assume Jamie is sad because they're alone" ❌  
Child selects Option B (if wrong choice, gentle guidance offers retry)  

**Step 3: Observation Phase**  
Magnifying glass activates  
Scene shows Jamie sitting alone with a book, small smile on face  
Observation checklist appears:  
- Body language: Relaxed, comfortable  
- Facial expression: Gentle smile  
- Activity: Reading, engaged  

Detective You notes: "Interesting! Jamie looks peaceful, not upset."  

**Step 4: Asking Questions**  
Question Mark tool activates  
Child selects questions to ask Jamie (can choose multiple):  
- "Are you feeling sad?" ✓  
- "Do you like sitting alone?" ✓  
- "Why are you being unfriendly?" ❌  

Jamie responds: "I'm not sad! I actually love reading during lunch. It's my quiet happy time. I have friends, but I also like being alone sometimes."  

**Step 5: Case Solved**  
Notepad updates: "Discovery: Jamie is happy—just expressing it quietly through reading alone. Quiet doesn't mean sad!"  
Heart tool activates: "Show empathy"  
Message to classmates: "Jamie likes quiet time alone. That's okay! Some people show happiness with friends, others show it with peaceful activities."  
Case File stamped: SOLVED  
Feedback: "You discovered: We can't assume feelings from behavior. We need to observe and ask!"  

---

#### Phase 2: Four More Cases (Minutes 3–9)

**Case 2: The Laughing Friend**  
New Investigation  
Case file: "Alex laughs a lot during group work. But then Alex suddenly left the room. What's happening?"  
Investigation reveals: Alex was laughing because they felt nervous (not happy)  
Questions uncover: "I laugh when I'm nervous. I left because I needed a break—feeling overwhelmed."  
Discovery: "Same expression (laughing) can mean different feelings (happy OR nervous)!"  

**Case 3: The Angry Artist**  
Cultural Expression Case  
Case file: "Maya's face looks angry when she's drawing, but she says she's not angry. What's going on?"  
Observation: Maya has concentrated, focused face (furrowed brow)  
Questions reveal: "I'm not angry—I'm focused! This is my 'thinking hard' face. My family says I look serious when I concentrate."  
Discovery: "Facial expressions can be misread. What looks angry might just be focus!"  

**Case 4: The Crying Winner**  
Complex Emotions Case  
Case file: "Jordan won the science fair and started crying. Everyone is confused. Are they sad?"  
Observation: Tears, but also smiling  
Questions reveal: "I'm so happy I could cry! These are happy tears. I worked so hard on this project!"  
Discovery: "Crying doesn't always mean sad. People can have happy tears, relief tears, proud tears!"  

**Case 5: The Silent Partner**  
Final Case  
Case file: "During partner work, Casey didn't talk much. The other student thinks Casey didn't care."  
Investigation process (full sequence):  
Observe: Casey was listening carefully, taking notes, working quietly  
Ask questions: "Were you interested in the project?"  
Casey responds: "Yes! I love this project. I'm a quiet worker. I like to think before I speak."  
Discovery: "Quiet participation is still participation! Different people contribute differently."

### Continuity Note
This game concludes Unit 6 by applying all four lessons in practical social scenarios: (1) feelings carry messages (investigating what feelings mean), (2) body signals provide clues (observing physical expressions), (3) feelings change over time (some cases involve feelings that shifted), and (4) expressions vary widely (the core lesson). By framing empathy as detective work—observing, questioning, discovering rather than assuming—children learn scientific observation skills alongside emotional intelligence. This completes the unit's progression from understanding feelings as personal experiences to recognizing them as universal human phenomena expressed in beautifully diverse ways.

## How Lesson 4 Fits into the Full Learning Arc

Lesson 4 completes the journey of **Unit 6: What Are Feelings?** by expanding students’ awareness from *self-understanding* to *understanding others*. The two home games—*Expression Around the World* and *Feelings Detective Agency*—translate empathy into a structured, cognitive skill: noticing, questioning, and interpreting feelings through observation rather than assumption. Together, they illustrate that while feelings are **biologically universal**, expressions are **culturally and personally diverse**.  

This final lesson integrates all prior insights:
- **Lesson 1** taught that feelings are information messengers.  
- **Lesson 2** revealed that feelings appear in the body.  
- **Lesson 3** showed that feelings change over time.  
- **Lesson 4** now demonstrates that everyone has feelings, but the *way* we show them differs across individuals, families, and cultures.  

> 🧭 **Learning Arc Summary:**  
> Inner Awareness → Body Awareness → Temporal Awareness → Social Awareness.  
> By the end of Unit 6, students see emotional life as both *scientifically observable* and *deeply human*: feelings connect us all, yet their expressions form a mosaic of individuality. Understanding this duality builds empathy grounded in curiosity—an essential bridge to the social systems explored in Unit 7 (“Family and Friendship Dynamics”).
