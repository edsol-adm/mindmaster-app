## Home Game 3A – Feelings Weather Station
> Jump to: [Setup](#setup) · [Play](#play) · [Scoring](#scoring) · [Win Condition](#win-condition) · [Continuity Note](#continuity-note)

### Learning Objective
Students will explain that feelings are temporary and change over time, identify examples of how feelings change in response to situations and time passing, and recognize that people move through feelings at different speeds.

### Game File Name & Format
`hg-06.03-01.html` — Simulation / Sandbox (from Science App Games)

### Game Purpose
Children manipulate variables (time, situations, comfort) to observe how a character's emotional "weather" changes in real-time. This interactive simulation demonstrates that feelings are temporary states that shift in response to conditions, just like weather patterns.

### Estimated Play Time
9–10 minutes

---

### Setup
**Opening Screen:**  
"Feelings change like weather! Run your own Weather Station and watch feelings shift."

**Main Display:**  
- Large "weather sky" showing current feeling state (sunny = happy, cloudy = neutral, rainy = sad, stormy = angry, foggy = confused, starry = calm)  
- Character (Sam) standing below the sky, with thought bubble showing current feeling  
- Control Panel with three variable controls:  
  - **Time Slider:** Morning → Afternoon → Evening → Night  
  - **Situation Dial:** Various events (fun activity, challenge, rest, loss, celebration, conflict)  
  - **Support Meter:** Alone ↔ With Friends/Family ↔ Getting Comfort  
- **Weather Log:** Records all weather changes observed  
- **Visual Style:** Bright, animated sky that shifts smoothly between weather states  

---

### Play

#### Phase 1: Free Exploration (Minutes 1–3)

**Step 1: Initial State**  
- Sam's sky shows: Partly cloudy (neutral/calm)  
- Sam's thought: "I'm feeling okay right now."  
- Instruction: "Try changing the controls! Watch how Sam's feeling weather changes."

**Step 2: First Experiment**  
- Child moves Situation Dial to "Fun Activity"  
- Sky animates to: Sunny (happy)  
- Sam: "I'm feeling happy! This is fun!"  
- Weather Log records: "Fun Activity → Happy (Sunny)"  
- Teaching note appears: "You discovered that situations affect feelings!"

**Step 3: Add Time Variable**  
- Child moves Time Slider to "Evening"  
- Sky gradually shifts: Sunny → Partly sunny → Calm (starry evening)  
- Sam: "I'm still content, but feeling more calm and tired now."  
- Weather Log: "Time passed → Feeling changed from excited-happy to calm-content"  
- Teaching note: "Time can change feelings even when the situation stays the same!"

**Step 4: Explore Uncomfortable Feelings**  
- Child changes Situation Dial to "Challenge" or "Loss"  
- Sky shifts to: Rainy (sad) or Stormy (frustrated)  
- Sam: "This feels hard. I feel sad/frustrated."  
- Instruction: "Can you help Sam's weather change? Try the Time Slider or Support Meter!"

---

#### Phase 2: Guided Challenges (Minutes 4–7)

**Step 5: Challenge 1 – "Speed of Change"**  
- Challenge prompt: "Sam feels stormy (angry). How fast can feelings change?"  
- Child has three options to test:  
  - **Option A:** Move Time Slider forward → Sky gradually clears over 3 time periods (Stormy → Cloudy → Partly cloudy)  
  - **Option B:** Change Situation Dial to "Celebration" → Sky quickly shifts to Sunny  
  - **Option C:** Move Support Meter to "Getting Comfort" → Sky slowly improves (Stormy → Rainy → Cloudy)  
- After testing: "You discovered that feelings change at different speeds depending on what helps!"

**Step 6: Challenge 2 – "Same Feeling, Different Speeds"**  
- Split screen shows two characters: Sam and Jamie  
- Both start with Rainy weather (sad)  
- Instruction: "Watch what happens when time passes for both of them"  
- Automatic animation:  
  - Sam's weather: Rainy → Cloudy → Partly cloudy (changes in 2 time steps)  
  - Jamie's weather: Rainy → Rainy → Rainy → Cloudy (changes in 4 time steps)  
- Teaching: "Different people move through feelings at different speeds. Both are normal!"

**Step 7: Challenge 3 – "Feelings Always Change"**  
- New scenario: Sam starts with Sunny weather (happy at a party)  
- Question: "Will Sam stay sunny forever?"  
- Child advances Time Slider through: Morning → Afternoon → Evening → Night  
- Weather naturally shifts: Sunny → Sunny → Calm (starry) → Foggy-sleepy  
- Sam: "The party was so fun! Now I'm tired and ready to rest. My happy feeling changed to calm and sleepy."  
- Teaching: "Even happy feelings don't last forever. ALL feelings change. That's how feelings work!"

---

#### Phase 3: Pattern Discovery (Minutes 8–10)

**Step 8: Weather Patterns Review**  
- Weather Log expands showing all observed changes  
- Question: "What did you discover? Check all that are true:"  
  - ☑ Situations can change feelings  
  - ☑ Time passing can change feelings  
  - ☑ Support from others can change feelings  
  - ☑ All feelings are temporary (they change)  
  - ☑ Different people change at different speeds  
- Child selects all five (all are correct based on experiments)

**Step 9: Personal Prediction**  
- New scenario appears: "Imagine you feel worried (foggy weather). What might help your feeling change?"  
- Child can manipulate all three controls to create a pathway:  
  - Example: Worried → Add "Getting Comfort" → Time passes → Feeling shifts to Calm  
- Multiple solutions accepted  
- Feedback: "You discovered your own weather-changing pattern!"

**Step 10: Final Weather Station Report**  
- Summary screen:  
  "Total weather changes observed: [X]"  
  "You're a Feelings Weather Scientist! You discovered:  
  - Feelings change over time  
  - Situations affect feelings  
  - Support can help feelings change  
  - Everyone changes at their own speed  
  - No feeling lasts forever!"

---

### Continuity Note
This game brings Lesson 3's core concept to life through interactive simulation: feelings are temporary, changeable states that respond to time, situations, and support. By manipulating variables and observing results, children learn feelings as dynamic processes (not fixed traits), building resilience and hope. This prepares them for Lesson 4's understanding that while feelings change universally, the way people express them during these changes varies individually.

## Home Game 3B – Change Helpers Challenge
> Jump to: [Setup](#setup-1) · [Play](#play-1) · [Scoring](#scoring-1) · [Win Condition](#win-condition-1) · [Continuity Note](#continuity-note-1)

### Learning Objective
Students will describe what helps feelings change (time passing, comfort from others, situation changing, body calming down) and apply understanding that uncomfortable feelings will pass.

### Game File Name & Format
`hg-06.03-02.html` — Tower Defense (adapted from Generic: Strategy Games)

### Game Purpose
Children strategically place "helper" tools along a path to support a character moving through uncomfortable feelings toward calm. This game-ified version of emotion regulation teaches that while feelings change naturally, certain supports can facilitate healthy transitions—all while maintaining the psychology-as-science framework (not therapy).

### Estimated Play Time
9–10 minutes

---

### Setup
**Opening Screen:**  
"Uncomfortable feelings don't last forever—but helpers can support healthy change! Let's see what helps!"

**Main Display:**  
- A winding path from left to right  
- Character (Riley) stands at the left side with a "feeling cloud" above (showing current uncomfortable feeling)  
- Path has 5 "stations" where child can place helpers  
- Helper toolkit at bottom showing 4 helper types (each has 3 uses, 12 total)  
- Goal Display: "Help Riley move from [Uncomfortable Feeling] to Calm!"  
- **Visual Style:** Friendly, non-competitive path game with bright colors, supportive tone  

---

### Play

#### Phase 1: Tutorial Level (Minutes 1–2)

**Step 1: Meet Riley**  
- Riley appears with "Nervous" cloud overhead (butterflies visible in stomach area)  
- Situation shown: "Riley has to give a presentation tomorrow"  
- Riley: "I feel so nervous! Will this feeling ever change?"

**Step 2: Helper Introduction**  
Four helper tools appear in toolkit:  
- Time Passing (clock icon) – "Lets time move forward"  
- Comfort Connection (hug icon) – "Support from others"  
- Situation Shift (change icon) – "Something about the situation improves"  
- Body Calming (breath icon) – "Body relaxation activities"

**Step 3: Place First Helper**  
- Instruction: "Drag a helper to Station 1 on the path!"  
- Child drags any helper to first station (tutorial accepts any choice)  
- Example: Child places "Body Calming"  
- Riley walks to station, interacts with helper  
- Animation shows: Riley takes deep breaths, shoulders relax  
- Feeling cloud shifts: "Nervous" → "Less Nervous" (cloud becomes lighter)  
- Feedback: "Body calming helped! The nervous feeling is still there, but not as strong."

**Step 4: Continue Path**  
- Child places 2 more helpers at stations 2 and 3  
- After each, Riley's feeling cloud lightens more  
- Station 2 (Time Passing): "The next day arrives—time helped!"  
- Station 3 (Comfort Connection): "Riley's friend says 'You've got this!'"  
- Final: Riley reaches end of path, feeling cloud shows "Calm"  
- Riley: "My nervous feeling changed! I feel much calmer now."

---

#### Phase 2: Challenge Levels (Minutes 3–8)

**Level 1: Sad to Calm**

**Step 5: New Scenario**  
- Riley appears with "Sad" cloud (heavy, blue)  
- Situation: "Riley's friend moved away"  
- Goal: "Help Riley's sad feeling change to calm. You have 5 stations and 12 helpers total."

**Step 6: Strategic Placement**  
- Child must choose which helpers to place at which stations  
- Can use multiple of the same type or vary them  
- Some combinations work better than others (teaching moment)  

Example effective sequence:  
- Station 1: Comfort Connection (someone listens to Riley)  
- Station 2: Time Passing (days go by)  
- Station 3: Body Calming (Riley does calming activities)  
- Station 4: Time Passing (more time)  
- Station 5: Situation Shift (Riley makes a new friend OR finds way to stay connected)

**Step 7: Observe Results**  
- After placing helpers, "Start Journey" button appears  
- Riley walks path, interacting with each helper  
- Feeling cloud gradually shifts: Sad → Less Sad → Thoughtful → Accepting → Calm  
- Each helper shows its effect with brief animation and text:  
  - "Comfort helped Riley feel less alone"  
  - "Time passing let the strong sad feeling soften"  
  - "Body calming gave Riley's body some rest"  
  - "Riley found a way to stay connected—situation improved a little"

**Step 8: Level Feedback**  
- If Riley reaches "Calm": "You succeeded! Sad feelings take time, but they do change."  
- If Riley only reaches "Less Sad": "Good start! Sad feelings are strong and take time. Sometimes we need more helpers or more time. Want to try again?"  
- Key teaching: "Notice: We used SEVERAL helpers. Big feelings often need multiple supports!"

---

**Level 2: Angry to Calm**

**Step 9: Angry Scenario**  
- Riley appears with "Angry" cloud (red, spiky)  
- Situation: "Someone broke Riley's project"  
- Goal: Help angry feeling change  
- Strategy: Child places 5 helpers  

Effective combinations might include:  
- Body Calming (releases angry energy)  
- Time Passing (anger intensity fades)  
- Situation Shift (project gets fixed or remade)  
- Comfort Connection (someone helps)  
- Time Passing (more time)  

Teaching moment: "Angry feelings can change quickly or slowly. Both are okay!"

---

**Level 3: Scared to Calm**

**Step 10: Scared Scenario**  
- Riley with "Scared" cloud (purple, shaky)  
- Situation: "Riley heard a strange sound at night"  
- Goal: Help scared feeling change  

Effective combinations:  
- Situation Shift (figure out what the sound was)  
- Comfort Connection (grown-up checks on Riley)  
- Body Calming (breathing helps body feel safer)  
- Time Passing (scary feeling fades)  

Teaching: "Sometimes scared changes fast when we understand the situation!"

---

#### Phase 3: Reflection & Pattern Discovery (Minutes 9–10)

**Step 11: Helper Review**  
- Summary screen: "You used helpers [X] times across all levels!"  
- Breakdown shown:  
  - Time Passing: Used [X] times  
  - Comfort Connection: Used [X] times  
  - Situation Shift: Used [X] times  
  - Body Calming: Used [X] times  

**Step 12: Pattern Questions**  
- "What did you discover? Select all that are true:"  
  - ☑ Uncomfortable feelings always change eventually  
  - ☑ Different helpers work for different feelings  
  - ☑ Sometimes we need MORE THAN ONE helper  
  - ☑ Time passing helps most feelings change  
  - ☑ Support from others can make change easier  
- Child selects answers (all are true based on gameplay)

**Step 13: Personal Connection**  
- "Think about a time YOU felt uncomfortable. What helped your feeling change?"  
- Four illustrated options to select (can choose multiple):  
  - Time passing  
  - Someone comforted me  
  - The situation changed  
  - My body calmed down  
- Feedback: "You discovered what works for you! Everyone has helpers that work best for them."

### Scoring
- Helper Placed: +5 points per helper placed strategically (up to 60 points for 12 helpers)  
- Level Completed: +30 points per level (3 levels = 90 points)  
- Efficient Path: +10 bonus if Riley reaches Calm using fewer than 5 helpers  
- Pattern Recognition: +5 points per correct pattern identified (25 points possible)  
- Personal Reflection: +10 points for engagement  
- **Total Possible:** 185+ points  

**Helper Levels:**  
- Helper Learner: 80+ points  
- Helper Strategist: 130+ points  
- Helper Expert: 170+ points  

---

### Win Condition
Child successfully helps Riley navigate at least 2 of 3 uncomfortable feelings to calm, correctly identifies at least 3 of 5 patterns, and engages with personal reflection.  
Final screen: "You're a Change Helper Expert! You discovered that uncomfortable feelings always change, and helpers can support healthy change."

---

### Continuity Note
This game operationalizes Lesson 3's resilience message: uncomfortable feelings are temporary, and understanding what facilitates change builds agency and hope. By testing different "helpers" in a game format, children learn practical supports (time, comfort, situation shifts, body calming) while maintaining the scientific framing that feelings change naturally—these are facilitators, not fixes. This prepares them for the full unit conclusion: feelings are universal, temporary, and manageable through understanding.

## How Lesson 3 Fits into the Full Learning Arc

Lesson 3 deepens the unit’s exploration of feelings by introducing **temporal awareness**—the understanding that feelings change over time and that this change is both natural and healthy. Building on Lessons 1 and 2 (which established feelings as information and as body-based signals), Lesson 3 normalizes the movement of emotions, showing that no feeling lasts forever and that this changeability is what makes coping possible. Through interactive play, students experience hope and agency: feelings are dynamic, not permanent states to fear or suppress. This perspective directly cultivates **resilience**, teaching children to trust in the natural rhythm of emotional change.

- **Lesson 1:** Feelings as information messengers.  
- **Lesson 2:** Feelings as body experiences.  
- **Lesson 3 (this lesson):** Feelings as temporary and changeable states.  
- **Lesson 4:** Feelings as universal but expressed differently across individuals.  

> 🧠 **Learning Arc Summary:** Cognitive Awareness → Body Awareness → Temporal Awareness → Social Awareness.  
> By progressing through these stages, students build a layered understanding of emotions as normal, observable, and manageable systems—strengthening both curiosity and self-efficacy as foundations for mental resilience.
