> Jump to: [Setup](#setup) · [Play](#play) · [Scoring](#scoring) · [Win Condition](#win-condition) · [Continuity Note](#continuity-note)

### Learning Objective
Students will locate where specific feelings appear in their body, match common body sensations to corresponding feelings, and demonstrate body awareness as an observational tool.

### Game File Name & Format
`hg-06.02-01.html` — Hidden Object (from Generic: Casual Games)

### Game Purpose
Children search illustrated scenes to find "hidden" body signals (physical sensations like butterflies, racing hearts, clenched fists) and match them to the feelings that create them. This makes the invisible (internal sensations) visible and discoverable, reinforcing mind-body connections.

### Estimated Play Time
8–10 minutes

---

### Setup
**Opening Screen:**  
"Feelings don't just live in our minds—they show up in our bodies too! Let's find where feelings hide in the body!"  

**Main Character:**  
A friendly guide character (Dr. Body, cartoon scientist with magnifying glass) appears:  
"Help me find 18 body signals hidden in these scenes!"  

**Scene Selection:**  
Three large cartoon scenes appear as buttons:  
- Scene 1: School Playground (6 body signals hidden)  
- Scene 2: Home Kitchen (6 body signals hidden)  
- Scene 3: Neighborhood Park (6 body signals hidden)  

**Signal Tracker:**  
"Body signals found: 0/18"  

**Visual Style:**  
Detailed but clean cartoon illustrations with multiple characters showing different feelings  

---

### Play

#### Scene 1: School Playground (Minutes 1–3)
**Step 1: Enter Scene**  
Large illustrated playground with 4–5 children doing different activities.  
Instruction: "Look carefully! Click on body parts where you see feeling signals."  

**Step 2: Find Hidden Signals**  
Child clicks around the scene to discover body signals:

- Hidden Signal 1: Click on a child's stomach area → Butterflies appear with animation  
  Popup: "Butterflies in stomach! Which feeling creates this?"  
  Three options: Happy / Nervous / Angry  
  Correct answer: Nervous  
  Feedback: "Yes! When we feel nervous or worried, we often get butterflies in our stomach."  
  Signal collected (1/18)  

- Hidden Signal 2: Click on another child's chest → Warm glow appears  
  "Warm chest! Which feeling?"  
  Options: Sad / Happy / Scared  
  Correct: Happy  
  Signal collected (2/18)  

- Hidden Signal 3: Click on child's fists → Clenched fists highlighted  
  "Tight, clenched fists! Which feeling?"  
  Options: Angry / Excited / Surprised  
  Correct: Angry  
  Signal collected (3/18)  

Signals 4–6 follow the same pattern:  
- Racing heart (Scared)  
- Bouncy legs (Excited)  
- Shoulders up/tense (Worried)  

**Step 3: Scene Complete**  
After finding all 6 signals:  
"You found all the playground body signals! Let's explore another scene."  
A brief summary shows the 6 signals found with their feelings.  

---

#### Scene 2: Home Kitchen (Minutes 4–6)
**Step 4: New Scene**  
Kitchen scene with family members showing various feelings.  
Same mechanics: click to discover hidden body signals.  

**Signals to Find (6 total):**  
- Tears in eyes (Sad)  
- Big smile on face (Happy)  
- Wide eyes looking around (Surprised or Excited)  
- Heavy, slumped shoulders (Sad)  
- Rapid breathing/open mouth (Scared)  
- Tight jaw (Angry)  

**Step 5: Pattern Recognition**  
After 3rd signal found, Dr. Body comments:  
"Notice: Some signals show up for similar feelings! Racing heart can mean scared OR excited. Bodies tell us to pay attention!"  

---

#### Scene 3: Neighborhood Park (Minutes 7–8)
**Step 6: Final Scene**  
Park scene with diverse group of children and adults.  
Most challenging: some signals are more subtle.  

**Signals to Find (6 total):**  
- Red/hot face (Angry or Embarrassed)  
- Hiding behind something (Scared or Shy)  
- Jumping up and down (Excited)  
- Curled up small (Sad or Scared)  
- Relaxed, loose body (Calm/Happy)  
- Gasping/hand over mouth (Surprised)  

**Step 7: Bonus Discovery**  
Hidden bonus: Click on any character's head → Thought bubble appears showing their feeling.  
Teaches: "We can see body signals (outside), but feelings live in the mind (inside)!"  

---

#### Phase 2: Signal Sorting Challenge (Final 2 Minutes)
**Step 8: Review All Signals**  
All 18 found signals appear on screen in random order.  
Six feeling categories appear as "baskets": Happy, Sad, Angry, Scared, Excited, Surprised.  
Instruction: "Drag each body signal to the feeling that creates it!"  

**Step 9: Drag and Match**  
Child drags signals to feelings.  
Some signals can go in multiple categories (e.g., "Racing heart" works for both Scared and Excited).  
Game accepts multiple valid answers with feedback:  
"Yes! Racing heart can mean scared OR excited. Bodies don't always tell us exactly which feeling—but they tell us to pay attention!"  

**Step 10: Completion**  
After sorting at least 15/18 correctly:  
"You're a Body Signals Expert! You discovered where feelings show up in the body."  

---

### Scoring
- Signal Found: +10 points per discovered signal (18 signals = 180 points)  
- Correct Feeling Match: +5 bonus points per correct match when signal discovered  
- Scene Completion Bonus: +20 points per completed scene (3 scenes = 60 points)  
- Sorting Challenge: +2 points per correct sort (up to 36 points)  
**Total Possible:** 276+ points  

**Star System:**  
- 1 star = 150 points (found most signals)  
- 2 stars = 200 points (found all signals, some correct matches)  
- 3 stars = 250+ points (found all, sorted correctly)  

---

### Win Condition
Child finds at least 15 of 18 body signals across all three scenes, correctly identifies feelings for at least 10 signals, and sorts at least 12 signals correctly in the final challenge.  
**Final Screen:** "You discovered how feelings show up all over the body! Mind and body work together."

---

### Continuity Note
This game brings Lesson 2's body awareness concept to life through visual search and discovery. By "finding" physical sensations in illustrated characters, children learn to observe these signals in themselves and others. This prepares them for Lesson 3 (noticing when body signals change as feelings change) and Lesson 4 (recognizing that while signals are common, expression varies).

## Home Game 2B – Feeling Pathway Builder
> Jump to: [Setup](#setup-1) · [Play](#play-1) · [Scoring](#scoring-1) · [Win Condition](#win-condition-1) · [Continuity Note](#continuity-note-1)

### Learning Objective
Students will distinguish between the mental experience of feeling and the physical experience, and recognize that mind and body work together as a connected system.

### Game File Name & Format
`hg-06.02-02.html` — Cause & Effect Chains (from Science App Games)

### Game Purpose
Children build visual flowcharts showing how external situations trigger mental feelings, which then create physical body signals. This reinforces the scientific understanding of feelings as observable cause-and-effect processes linking situation → mind → body.

### Estimated Play Time
8–10 minutes

---

### Setup
**Opening Screen:**  
"Feelings are like pathways: Something happens → Your mind feels → Your body shows! Let's build feeling pathways!"  

**Main Display:**  
Three-column pathway builder:  
- Column 1 (Left): "SITUATION – What Happens"  
- Column 2 (Middle): "MIND – What You Feel"  
- Column 3 (Right): "BODY – What Your Body Shows"  

**Starting Materials:** 24 cards scattered below (8 situations, 8 feelings, 8 body signals)  
**Character Guide:** Pathway Professor (friendly cartoon teacher with pointer)  
**Visual Style:** Clean flowchart aesthetic with arrows connecting columns, bright card designs  

---

### Play

#### Phase 1: Guided Building (Minutes 1–3)
**Step 1: First Pathway (Tutorial)**  
- Pathway Professor: "Let's build your first pathway together!"  
- Situation card highlights: "Your friend invites you to their birthday party"  
- Instruction: "Drag this to the SITUATION column"  
- Child drags card to Column 1  

**Step 2: Add Feeling**  
- Three feeling cards highlight: Happy / Nervous / Sad  
- Question: "What might your mind feel?"  
- Child selects one (accepts any as valid)  
- Example choice: Happy  
- Card automatically moves to Column 2 (MIND)  

**Step 3: Add Body Signal**  
- Three body signal cards highlight: Warm chest & smile / Butterflies in stomach / Racing heart  
- Question: "If you feel happy, what might your body show?"  
- Correct matches: Warm chest & smile (most common) OR Bouncy energy  
- Child drags match to Column 3 (BODY)  

**Step 4: Activate Pathway**  
- "Test Pathway" button appears.  
- Child clicks it.  
- Animation flows: Situation card → Feeling card → Body signal card (with connecting arrows lighting up).  
- Feedback: "You built a complete pathway! Situation → Mind → Body. This is how feelings work!"  
- Pathway locks in place with checkmark.  

---

#### Phase 2: Independent Building (Minutes 4–7)
**Step 5: Build 4 More Pathways**  
Child independently builds pathways with these combinations (can choose from available cards):

- Pathway 2 Example: Situation: "You hear a loud, scary sound" → Mind: Scared → Body: Racing heart, tense body  
- Pathway 3 Example: Situation: "Someone took your toy without asking" → Mind: Angry → Body: Hot face, clenched fists  
- Pathway 4 Example: Situation: "Your tower of blocks fell down" → Mind: Sad OR Frustrated → Body: Heavy chest, slumped shoulders OR tight body  
- Pathway 5 Example: Situation: "You're about to perform in a show" → Mind: Excited OR Nervous (both valid!) → Body: Bouncy/can't sit still OR butterflies in stomach  

**Step 6: Validation System**  
- After each pathway, child clicks "Test Pathway".  
- If logically connected: Pathway activates with flow animation, locks in.  
- If mismatch (e.g., "Birthday party" → "Scared" → "Warm chest"):  
- "Hmm, let's check this pathway. Does this situation usually create this feeling? Try again!"  
- Child can adjust and retest.  

**Step 7: Multiple Valid Answers**  
- Game recognizes that some situations create different feelings for different people.  
- Example: "About to perform" can → Excited OR Nervous (both accepted).  
- Feedback: "Correct! Different people might feel differently in this situation. Both pathways work!"  

---

#### Phase 3: Change & Observation (Minutes 8–10)
**Step 8: Pathway Transformation**  
- New challenge screen: "What happens when situations CHANGE?"  
- One completed pathway is shown:  
- Situation: "Your friend is playing with you" → Mind: Happy → Body: Smiling, relaxed.  

**Step 9: Situation Swap**  
- New situation card appears: "Your friend has to go home."  
- Question: "If the situation changes, what happens to the mind and body?"  
- Child observes as the pathway automatically transforms:  
- "Your friend has to go home" → Mind: Sad → Body: Heavy chest, quiet.  
- Text: "You discovered it! When situations change, feelings change, and body signals change too!"  

**Step 10: Interactive Transformation**  
Child gets 3 more transformation challenges:  
- "Hear a scary sound" → "Realize it was just the wind" (Scared → Calm)  
- "About to go on a fun trip" → "Trip is over" (Excited → Tired/Content)  
- "Someone took your turn" → "They apologized" (Angry → Okay/Accepting)  
For each, child drags NEW feeling and body signal cards to show the change.  
Reinforces: External events → Internal feelings → Physical signals (dynamic, not static).  

**Step 11: Completion Summary**  
- Screen shows all 5 built pathways plus 3 transformations.  
- "You built 8 complete pathways! You discovered how situation, mind, and body are connected."  

---

### Scoring
- Pathway Built: +20 points per complete pathway (5 pathways = 100 points)  
- Correct Logical Connection: +10 bonus per pathway with strong logic  
- Transformation Recognized: +15 points per transformation completed (3 = 45 points)  
- Speed Bonus: +5 points if pathway built in under 30 seconds (optional, up to 25 points)  
**Total Possible:** 170+ points  

**Badge System:**  
- Bronze Pathway Builder: 100+ points (3–4 pathways built)  
- Silver Pathway Builder: 130+ points (5 pathways + 1–2 transformations)  
- Gold Pathway Builder: 160+ points (all pathways + all transformations)  

---

### Win Condition
Child successfully builds at least 4 complete pathways with logical situation → feeling → body connections, and completes 2+ transformation challenges.  
**Final Screen:** "You're a Pathway Builder! You understand how situation, mind, and body work together."

---

### Continuity Note
This game explicitly teaches the causal sequence that underlies Lesson 2: external situations trigger internal mental experiences (feelings), which manifest as observable physical signals (body sensations). By building and testing these pathways, children develop a scientific model of feelings as dynamic processes. This prepares them for Lesson 3 (when situations change, the entire pathway changes) and reinforces that feelings are understandable, predictable patterns—not random events.

## How Lesson 2 Fits into the Full Learning Arc

Lesson 2 deepens children’s understanding of feelings by connecting the **inner world of emotion** to the **outer world of the body**. If Lesson 1 introduced feelings as valuable messengers carrying information, Lesson 2 makes that information *observable and concrete*: children learn that emotions speak not only through words but also through the body’s signals—heartbeats, postures, and movements.  

By discovering that every feeling has both a mental and physical side, students gain tools for self-awareness: they can notice what their bodies are telling them before feelings grow stronger or more complex. This builds early emotional regulation through understanding, not instruction. The experience also strengthens the scientific view of psychology—mind and body as parts of one connected system.

- **Lesson 1:** Introduced feelings as information messengers.  
- **Lesson 2 (this lesson):** Grounds feelings in body awareness, revealing how emotions show up as physical signals.  
- **Lesson 3:** Explores how those feelings (and signals) change over time, teaching emotional impermanence.  
- **Lesson 4:** Expands understanding to others, showing that while all people have feelings, expressions vary across individuals and cultures.  

> 🧠 **Learning Arc Summary:** From Inner Awareness → Bodily Observation → Emotional Change → Empathic Understanding.  
> Lesson 2 acts as the bridge between knowing *that feelings exist* and *noticing how they manifest*. This mind–body connection transforms abstract emotion into something observable and manageable—laying the groundwork for resilience through awareness and curiosity.
