> Jump to: [Setup](#setup) · [Play](#play) · [Scoring](#scoring) · [Win Condition](#win-condition) · [Continuity Note](#continuity-note)

### Learning Objective
Students will identify and name common feelings (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, excitement, surprise) and understand that each feeling carries a message about ourselves and our situations.

### Game File Name & Format
`hg-06.01-01.html` — Match-3 Puzzle (from Generic: Puzzle Games)

### Game Purpose
Children match three or more identical feeling symbols to "deliver" the messages those feelings carry. Each successful match reveals what that feeling tells us, reinforcing that feelings are information messengers with specific purposes.

### Estimated Play Time
6–8 minutes

---

### Setup
**Opening Screen:**  
A colorful grid (6×6) filled with feeling symbols: happy faces, sad faces, angry faces, scared faces, excited faces, surprised faces (six different types)

**Character Guide:**  
A friendly mail carrier character (cartoon style) appears at the side: "Help me deliver feeling messages! Match 3 or more of the same feeling to send their message!"

**Message Board:**  
Empty message board on the right side of screen where delivered messages will appear

**Tutorial:**  
Brief animation shows how to swap adjacent symbols to create matches of 3+ in a row (horizontal or vertical)

**Visual Style:**  
Bright, clean cartoon aesthetic with expressive feeling symbols (not realistic faces)

---

### Play

#### Phase 1: Basic Matching (First 3 Minutes)

**Step 1: Making Matches**
- Child taps one feeling symbol, then taps an adjacent symbol to swap positions  
- If swap creates a line of 3+ matching feelings, they disappear with a gentle pop animation  
- New symbols fall from top to fill empty spaces  
- Each match earns points and adds a message to the Message Board  

**Step 2: Message Delivery**
- When child matches 3+ Happy symbols: Message Board displays "HAPPY tells us: Something good is happening!"  
- When child matches 3+ Sad symbols: "SAD tells us: Something we care about is lost or missing."  
- When child matches 3+ Angry symbols: "ANGRY tells us: Something feels unfair or a boundary was crossed."  
- When child matches 3+ Scared symbols: "SCARED tells us: Be careful—there might be danger nearby."  
- When child matches 3+ Excited symbols: "EXCITED tells us: Something interesting is about to happen!"  
- When child matches 3+ Surprised symbols: "SURPRISED tells us: Something unexpected just happened!"  

**Step 3: Message Collection**
- Each unique feeling message can be delivered multiple times  
- Progress tracker shows: "Messages delivered: 8/15" (child needs 15 total matches)  
- Mail carrier character responds: "You're discovering what feelings tell us!"  

#### Phase 2: Combo Discovery (Minutes 4–6)

**Step 4: Special Matches**
- Matching 4 in a row: Creates a "Super Messenger" symbol that clears an entire row when matched  
- Matching 5 in a row: Creates a "Message Burst" that clears all symbols of that feeling type across the board  
- Visual feedback: Sparkles, gentle whoosh sounds, message animations  

**Step 5: All Messages Delivered**
- After 15 successful matches, the Message Board is full  
- Mail carrier: "You delivered all the feeling messages! Let's review what we learned."  

#### Phase 3: Review Quiz (Final 2 Minutes)

**Step 6: Quick Check**
- Grid clears; 4 quick review questions appear one at a time  
- Format: "Which feeling tells us something good is happening?"  
- Three feeling symbols appear (happy, sad, scared)  
- Child taps the correct one  
- Questions cover all 6 feelings  
- Immediate neutral feedback: "Yes, that's the message Happy carries!" or "Not quite—let's think about what Scared tells us."  

**Step 7: Completion**
- After review, final message: "You discovered what all 6 feelings tell us! Feelings are messengers carrying important information."  

---

### Scoring
- Basic Match (3 symbols): +10 points  
- Good Match (4 symbols): +20 points + Super Messenger  
- Excellent Match (5 symbols): +50 points + Message Burst  
- Combo Matches (cascading matches): +5 bonus per combo  
- Review Questions: +25 points per correct answer  
- Total Target Score: 300 points to complete  
- Visual Progress: Star meter fills as points accumulate (1 star = 100 points, 3 stars = completion)

---

### Win Condition
Child successfully makes 15 matches to fill the Message Board, completes the 4-question review with at least 3 correct answers, and earns at least 2 stars (200+ points).  
Final screen: "You're a Feelings Message Expert! You know what each feeling tells us."

---

### Continuity Note
This game establishes the foundational concept that feelings are functional messengers (Lesson 1). By making matching fun and rewarding, children internalize the six basic feelings and their messages, preparing them to explore where these feelings appear in the body (Lesson 2 games), how they change over time (Lesson 3 games), and how they're expressed differently (Lesson 4 games).

### Continuity Note
This game deepens Lesson 1's perspective-taking concept through interactive  discovery. By exploring a shared environment where different characters experience different feelings, children build empathy and scientific understanding that feelings are subjective responses. This prepares them for Lesson 4 (where expressions, not just feelings, vary) and reinforces the foundation for understanding feelings as personal experiences.

## How Lesson 1 Fits into the Full Learning Arc

Lesson 1 introduces **feelings as the mind’s messenger system**—each emotion delivers useful information about what’s happening within us and around us. The two home games turn this abstract idea into active discovery: *Feelings Message Match* transforms emotional recognition into a fun matching process where each feeling “delivers” its message, while *The Feeling Guessing Game* expands that understanding through perspective-taking, showing that the same situation can evoke different emotions in different people.

- **Lesson 1 (this document):** Establishes that all feelings have functions—they are information signals, not “good” or “bad” states.  
- **Lesson 2:** Brings this understanding into the body, showing that feelings produce recognizable physical sensations that can be observed and used as clues.  
- **Lesson 3:** Introduces feelings as temporary experiences that change over time, normalizing emotional movement and supporting resilience.  
- **Lesson 4:** Expands awareness toward empathy—everyone has feelings, though the ways we express them differ.

> 🧠 **Learning Arc Summary:** Cognitive Awareness → Body Awareness → Temporal Awareness → Social Awareness.  
> Through this arc, students come to see feelings not as unpredictable moods but as understandable signals that connect mind and body, self and others. Recognizing feelings as messages strengthens both emotional insight and self-efficacy—key foundations for resilience and empathy in later units.
