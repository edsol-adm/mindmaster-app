## In-Class-Game 6A – Mystery Message Reveal

## Lesson 1: Different Feelings and What They Tell Us

### Lesson Link & Learning Objective

Identify at least four common feelings (happy, sad, angry, scared, excited) using words or pictures; describe what information each feeling communicates (e.g., "Fear warns me about danger" or "Sadness tells me something important to me is gone or hurt"); recognize that the same event can create different feelings in different people.

### Game File Name: icg-06.01-game01.html

### Game Title: ****Mystery Message Reveal****

### Game Format: **Format:** Mystery Reveal  

****Justification:**** This format has 0 uses across all units (virgin format). It directly supports the lesson's core learning objectives by revealing information progressively-each correct answer about a feeling uncovers part of a hidden image, reinforcing the concept that feelings carry messages that can be "discovered" through observation and reasoning. The progressive reveal mechanic creates engagement while modeling the scientific process of gathering evidence to understand psychological phenomena. This format is click-compatible, developmentally appropriate for Grade 1, and creates natural momentum through the game as the mystery unfolds.

### Purpose: Students practice identifying feelings and matching them to the information messages they carry. As students answer correctly, pieces of a hidden image are revealed, creating a visual metaphor for "uncovering" the messages that feelings bring. This reinforces the psychology-as-science principle that feelings are observable information systems that can be studied, understood, and decoded

### Lesson Arc Location****:**** Explore/Practice B (approximately 30 minutes into the 45-minute lesson). After Explore A (feelings as messengers introduction), Practice A (video showing feelings in context), and Practice B (quiz on feelings messages), before Reflection

**Rationale:** This placement is pedagogically optimal because students have already:

- Been introduced to the concept of feelings as information messengers (Explore A)
- Observed feelings in story context through video (Practice A)
- Tested their initial understanding through the quiz (Practice B)

The game serves as consolidation and extension-taking the foundational knowledge from Explore A and the observational learning from Practice A, then applying it to novel scenarios. The mystery reveal format adds a discovery element that makes the abstract concept of "feelings carry messages" concrete and engaging. Placing it before reflection allows the reflection activity to draw on game experiences, deepening discussion quality about what messages different feelings bring.

### Setup

**Starting Screen:**

- **Background:** A large framed picture covered by 6 puzzle-piece-shaped panels (numbered 1-6), set against a warm classroom backdrop with bookshelves
- **Character:** Professor Pip the Message Detective (friendly cartoon owl wearing detective hat and holding magnifying glass) appears on left side
- **Professor Pip says:** "Welcome, Feelings Detectives! Behind these puzzle pieces is a special hidden picture. Each time you discover what message a feeling brings, you'll reveal part of the mystery! Let's start investigating!"
- **Visual elements:**
  - Large frame (center) with 6 covered sections arranged in 2 rows of 3
  - Each section labeled with number (1-6)
  - Progress tracker (top right): "Messages Discovered: 0/6"
  - Detective badge icon (top left)
- **UI elements:**
  - "Begin Investigation" button (center bottom)
  - Clicker instruction icon showing buttons 1-4
  - Small magnifying glass animation scanning across the covered picture

**First Interaction:** Student clicks "Begin Investigation" button (or presses any clicker button) to begin Round 1.

### Play

**Round Structure:** The game consists of 6 rounds. Each round presents a scenario, asks students to identify the feeling, then match it to the message that feeling carries. Each correct message match reveals one puzzle piece of the hidden picture.

**Each Round follows this sequence:**

**Step 1: Scenario Introduction**

- One puzzle piece pulses with a gentle glow to indicate which piece this round will reveal

## In-Class-Game 6B – Body Signal Spotter

## Lesson 2: How Feelings Show Up in Our Bodies

### Lesson Link & Learning Objective

Locate where specific feelings appear in their body by pointing to or naming the physical location (e.g., butterflies in stomach for nervous, warmth in chest for happy); match common body sensations to corresponding feelings (e.g., tight shoulders → worried, clenched fists → angry, bouncy energy → excited); distinguish between the mental experience of feeling ("knowing I feel scared") and the physical experience ("my heart beats fast").

### Game File Name: icg-06.02-game01.html

### Game Title: ****Body Signal Spotter****

### Game Format: Spot the Difference / Odd One Out  

****Justification:**** This format has 0 uses across all units (virgin format). Adapted here as "Spot the Body Signal," this format trains students to notice and identify specific physical manifestations of feelings by distinguishing which body signals match particular emotions. The observation and comparison mechanic supports the lesson's core objective of recognizing that feelings create detectable body signals. Students practice the scientific skill of careful observation-identifying patterns and anomalies in how bodies display emotional states. This format is click-compatible, age-appropriate, and models the empirical observation central to psychology as science.

### Purpose: Students practice identifying where and how feelings show up in the body by observing characters displaying physical signals and selecting which body signal matches the given feeling. This reinforces the psychology-as-science principle that emotions are not just mental experiences-they create observable, measurable physical responses in predictable body locations that can be studied and understood systematically

### Lesson Arc Location: Explore/Practice B (approximately 20-22 minutes into the 45-minute lesson). After Explore A (teacher modeling of feelings in body), Practice A (individual body map activity), before Explore/Practice C (Psychology Experiment - "Where's the Feeling?" physical pointing activity), before Practice C (video), before Quiz, before Reflection

**Rationale:** This placement is pedagogically optimal because students have already:

- Experienced a body scan to activate awareness of physical sensations (Warm-up)
- Seen teacher model where common feelings appear in the body using body outline poster (Explore A)
- Created their own body maps marking where they personally feel different emotions (Practice A)

The game serves as transition from personal mapping to observational science-taking the self-awareness developed in Practice A and applying it to systematic observation of body signals in others. The "spot the signal" mechanic reinforces pattern recognition across multiple examples, building empirical evidence that feelings consistently create physical manifestations. Placing it before the physical experiment allows students to observe patterns first, then test those patterns on themselves. The subsequent video and quiz then provide additional reinforcement after hands-on discovery.

### Setup

**Starting Screen:**

- **Background:** Simple science observation lab with large viewing screen in center showing observation area
- **Character:** Dr. Maya the Body Scientist (friendly cartoon avatar wearing white lab coat, holding tablet with body outline diagram) appears on left side
- **Dr. Maya says:** "Welcome to the Body Signal Lab! Feelings don't just happen in our minds-they show up in our bodies too. Let's train our observation skills and spot the body signals!"
- **Visual elements:**
  - Large observation screen (center) currently showing empty observation area
  - "Signal Spotter Training" banner at top
  - Progress tracker (top right): "Signals Spotted: 0/6"
  - Lab clipboard with checklist icon (top left)
- **UI elements:**
  - "Start Observation Training" button (center bottom)
  - Clicker instruction icon showing buttons 1-4
  - Small body outline reference diagram (bottom left corner)

**First Interaction:** Student clicks "Start Observation Training" button (or presses any clicker button) to begin Round 1.

### Play

**Round Structure:** The game consists of 6 rounds. Each round presents a feeling name, then shows 3-4 characters displaying different body signals. Students must identify which character is showing the body signal that matches the named feeling.

**Each Round follows this sequence:**

**Step 1: Feeling Announcement**

- Dr. Maya says: "Let's look for the body signals of \[feeling name\]!"
- Large text appears center screen: "\[FEELING NAME\]"
- Feeling word is accompanied by simple emoji face showing that emotion
- Dr. Maya provides brief reminder: "Remember, \[feeling name\] often shows up as \[brief clue about body location-e.g., 'butterflies or tightness in the middle of your body'\]."

**Step 2: Character Display**

- Observation screen shows 4 cartoon characters standing side by side (numbered 1-4)
- Each character displays a different body signal through visual cues:
  - Character poses showing different physical states
  - Visual indicators (subtle glow, motion lines, expression) highlighting specific body areas
  - Examples: one holds stomach, one has tense shoulders, one shows clenched fists, one bounces with energy
- All characters are the same child avatar (gender-neutral) in different poses to focus attention on body signals rather than character identity

**Step 3: Signal Identification Question**

- Dr. Maya says: "Which character is showing the body signal for \[feeling name\]?"
- Prompt below characters: "Look carefully at each body signal. Click 1, 2, 3, or 4 to choose."
- All students vote simultaneously using clickers
- Timer: 12 seconds (visual countdown bar)
- During countdown, subtle animation loops on each character to show their signal clearly

**Step 4: Answer Reveal & Feedback**

- Correct character highlights with green glow around body
- Incorrect characters fade slightly
- Dr. Maya says: "Yes! Character \[#\] shows \[feeling name\]. Look at \[specific body signal description\]."
- The correct body signal is emphasized with pulsing highlight (e.g., stomach area glows for nervous, shoulders glow for worried)
- Brief science explanation appears in text bubble: "When we feel \[feeling\], our body often \[physical response explanation\]."

**Step 5: Body Location Marking**

- A simplified body outline appears on side of screen
- The identified body location lights up and is labeled with the feeling name
- This creates a cumulative "body map" showing all discovered signals as game progresses
- Progress updates: "Signals Spotted: 1/6" → "2/6" etc.

**Step 6: Next Round Transition**

- Dr. Maya says: "Excellent observation! Let's spot another body signal."
- Characters reset to neutral poses
- After 2-second pause, next round begins automatically

**Six Rounds Content:**

**Round 1: Nervous**

- **Feeling announced:** "NERVOUS"
- **Dr. Maya's clue:** "Nervous often shows up as fluttery or tight feelings in your middle."
- **Four characters:**
  - Character 1: Holds stomach area, slight bend forward, worried face ✓ CORRECT
  - Character 2: Shoulders raised up high and tense
  - Character 3: Fists clenched at sides, jaw tight
  - Character 4: Bouncing slightly, arms moving, big smile
- **Feedback:** "Yes! Character 1 shows nervous. Look at the hands on the stomach-that fluttery, tight feeling in the belly is a common body signal for nervous."
- **Science note:** "When we feel nervous, our stomach muscles can tighten, creating that 'butterflies' feeling."

**Round 2: Worried**

- **Feeling announced:** "WORRIED"
- **Dr. Maya's clue:** "Worry often makes muscles in the upper body tight and tense."
- **Four characters:**
  - Character 1: Relaxed posture, calm face, loose arms
  - Character 2: Shoulders pulled up high toward ears, neck tense, concerned face ✓ CORRECT
  - Character 3: Holding stomach gently
  - Character 4: Chest puffed out, arms crossed loosely
- **Feedback:** "Correct! Character 2 shows worried. Notice how the shoulders are pulled up tight and the neck looks tense-that's where worry often shows up."
- **Science note:** "Worry makes our shoulder and neck muscles tense up, getting ready to protect us."

**Round 3: Angry**

- **Feeling announced:** "ANGRY"
- **Dr. Maya's clue:** "Anger makes our muscles tighten, especially in the hands and face."
- **Four characters:**
  - Character 1: Loose posture, open hands, neutral face
  - Character 2: Slight bend, hand on stomach
  - Character 3: Tight fists clenched, jaw clenched, face red, body rigid ✓ CORRECT
  - Character 4: Shoulders hunched up
- **Feedback:** "Yes! Character 3 shows angry. See the tight fists, clenched jaw, and tense body-anger makes our muscles prepare for action."
- **Science note:** "When angry, our body tenses up with clenched fists and tight jaw, preparing to respond to what feels unfair."

**Round 4: Scared**

- **Feeling announced:** "SCARED"
- **Dr. Maya's clue:** "Fear makes our heart work faster and can make us hold very still or want to run."
- **Four characters:**
  - Character 1: Wide eyes, hand over heart area (heart beating fast indicated by small pulse animation), body slightly pulled back ✓ CORRECT
  - Character 2: Big smile, bouncing energy
  - Character 3: Calm, relaxed shoulders
  - Character 4: Fists clenched
- **Feedback:** "Correct! Character 1 shows scared. Notice the hand over the heart-the heart beats fast when we're scared, and the body might freeze or get ready to run."
- **Science note:** "Fear makes our heart pump faster to send blood to our muscles quickly, preparing us to stay safe."

**Round 5: Excited**

- **Feeling announced:** "EXCITED"
- **Dr. Maya's clue:** "Excitement fills the whole body with bouncy, moving energy."
- **Four characters:**
  - Character 1: Slumped, arms hanging
  - Character 2: Tense shoulders up high
  - Character 3: Whole body bouncing slightly, feet lifting, arms in motion, big smile, energetic posture ✓ CORRECT
  - Character 4: Standing very still, hand on heart
- **Feedback:** "Yes! Character 3 shows excited. Look at all that bouncy energy-excitement makes our whole body want to move and jump!"
- **Science note:** "Excitement fills our body with energy that makes us want to move, bounce, and take action."

**Round 6: Happy**

- **Feeling announced:** "HAPPY"
- **Dr. Maya's clue:** "Happiness often creates warm, light feelings, especially in the chest and face."
- **Four characters:**
  - Character 1: Slumped posture, downturned expression
  - Character 2: Warm glow in chest area, gentle smile, relaxed open posture, light stance ✓ CORRECT
  - Character 3: Rigid body, tight jaw
  - Character 4: Hand on stomach, bent forward
- **Feedback:** "Correct! Character 2 shows happy. Notice the warm feeling in the chest and the relaxed, light body-happiness often feels warm and cozy inside."
- **Science note:** "When happy, our chest can feel warm and light, and our whole body feels relaxed and comfortable."

### Scoring

**Points System:**

- Correct body signal identification: **1 star** per round
- Maximum possible: **6 stars total** (1 per round × 6 rounds)

**Body Map Progress:**

- As each round is completed correctly, the cumulative body outline on side of screen gains a new labeled location
- By game end, students see a complete body map showing all 6 feeling locations
- This visual serves as learning artifact: nervous→stomach, worried→shoulders, angry→fists/jaw, scared→heart, excited→whole body, happy→chest

**No penalties:** Incorrect answers provide immediate corrective feedback showing the correct character and highlighting the specific body signal. No points subtracted. This maintains psychological safety and supports observational learning.

**Visual feedback:**

- Stars appear in collection bar at top as earned
- Each correctly identified signal adds to the cumulative body map
- Progress tracker updates with each successful observation

### Win Condition

**Completion:** Game is complete when all 6 body signals have been spotted and identified (all 6 rounds played).

**Success Screen:**

- Complete body map displayed showing all 6 labeled feeling locations
- Dr. Maya says: "Training complete! You spotted 6 body signals. Now you know that feelings show up in our bodies in specific ways. This helps us notice and understand our feelings better!"
- Star count displayed: "\[X\]/6 signals correctly spotted"
- Badge awarded based on performance:
  - 6 stars: "Expert Body Signal Spotter" (gold badge)
  - 4-5 stars: "Body Signal Spotter" (silver badge)
  - 1-3 stars: "Signal Spotter in Training" (bronze badge)
- Neutral acknowledgment: "You identified body signals for \[X\] feelings."
- **Key learning summary:** "Remember: Our bodies and minds work together. Body signals help us notice feelings early!"

**Body Map Reference:**

- Dr. Maya says: "Take a look at your Body Signal Map!"
- Complete reference diagram shows: Nervous (stomach), Worried (shoulders), Angry (fists/jaw), Scared (heart), Excited (whole body), Happy (chest)
- Text: "Everyone's body is a little different, but these are common signals many people feel."

**Return Navigation:**

- "Return to the park" button → links to lesson-06.02.html
- Button is keyboard-focusable (tab-accessible)

### Continuity Note

**Links to Prior Learning:** Builds directly on Lesson 1's identification of feelings by adding the physical dimension. Extends the "feelings as messengers" concept from Lesson 1 to show that bodies also send observable signals-feelings are not abstract but embodied and detectable.

**Links to Future Learning:** Prepares for Lesson 3 (Feelings Change) by establishing that body signals can be observed and tracked. Students will later notice how these physical sensations shift as feelings change over time. Also prepares for the "Where's the Feeling?" physical experiment that follows immediately in this lesson, where students will apply observational learning to their own bodies.

### Estimated Play Time

**8-10 minutes** (approximately 1.5 minutes per round × 6 rounds, including feedback and body map building)

## In-Class-Game 6C – Feeling Forecast Lab

## Lesson 3: Feelings Change (And That's Normal)

### Lesson Link & Learning Objective

Explain that feelings are temporary and change over time, using weather as a concrete analogy (e.g., "Feelings can move from sad to calm, like weather from rainy to sunny"); identify examples of how feelings changed in a story or personal experience (e.g., "I felt nervous before the assembly, then excited during it, then tired after"); recognize that people move through feelings at different speeds-some quickly, others more slowly-and both patterns are normal.

### Game File Name: icg-06.03-game01.html

### Game Title: ****Feeling Forecast Lab****

### **Game Format**: **Format:** Categorize by Sequence (First→Next→Last)  

**Justification:** This format has 0 uses across all units (virgin format). This format is ideal for teaching the temporal nature of feelings because it requires students to observe, predict, and sequence emotional changes across time. The chronological ordering mechanic directly mirrors the lesson's core concept that feelings are not static but flow in predictable patterns from one state to another. By arranging feeling sequences, students practice the scientific skill of tracking variables (emotions) across time-a fundamental concept in psychology research. This format is click-compatible, age-appropriate, and models empirical observation of emotional dynamics.

### **Purpose**: Students practice predicting and sequencing how feelings change over time by observing scenarios and arranging feelings in chronological order (beginning→middle→end). This reinforces the psychology-as-science principle that feelings are temporary, dynamic states that follow observable patterns of change-building resilience through the understanding that uncomfortable feelings will naturally shift and pass

### **Lesson Arc Location**: Practice A (approximately 20 minutes into the 45-minute lesson). After Explore A (Story of Changing Feelings using story cards), Practice B (Feelings Change Timeline Activity where students created their own timelines), before Practice C (MindMaster Quiz - "What Feeling Comes Next?"), before Explore/Practice B (video), before Explore C (Psychology Experiment), before Reflection

**Rationale:** This placement is pedagogically optimal because students have already:

- Connected feelings to weather through opening discussion establishing temporal metaphor (Warm-up)
- Heard a story demonstrating feelings changing over time with clear beginning-middle-end structure (Explore A)
- Created their own feelings timeline from personal experience, marking start-middle-end sequences (Practice B)

The game serves as application and pattern recognition-taking the narrative examples from Explore A and the personal mapping from Practice B, then applying temporal sequencing skills to new scenarios. The "forecast" metaphor extends the weather analogy from warm-up while the sequencing mechanic builds on the timeline work just completed in Practice B. Placing it before the quiz allows the quiz to assess both observational learning (from story) AND predictive sequencing skills (from game). The video and experiment then provide additional reinforcement of the change concept using different modalities.

### Setup

**Starting Screen:**

- **Background:** Weather station control room with large forecast display board showing three time slots (Morning, Afternoon, Evening) and weather icons transitioning across sky
- **Character:** Meteorologist Mika (friendly cartoon character wearing weather forecaster outfit with clipboard, standing next to weather map) appears on left side
- **Mika says:** "Welcome to the Feeling Forecast Lab! Just like weather changes from morning to evening, our feelings change too. Let's practice predicting how feelings move and shift over time!"
- **Visual elements:**
  - Large forecast board (center) with three empty slots labeled "START → MIDDLE → END"
  - Weather transition animation in background (sun → clouds → sun pattern looping)
  - Progress tracker (top right): "Forecasts Completed: 0/6"
  - Forecast accuracy meter (top left) showing stars collected
- **UI elements:**
  - "Begin Forecasting" button (center bottom)
  - Clicker instruction icon showing buttons 1-4
  - Small weather/feeling connection key (bottom left): sun=happy, clouds=sad, lightning=angry, etc.

**First Interaction:** Student clicks "Begin Forecasting" button (or presses any clicker button) to begin Round 1.

### Play

**Round Structure:** The game consists of 6 rounds. Each round presents a scenario and three feelings. Students must arrange the feelings in chronological order (which feeling came first, which came next, which came last) by selecting the correct sequence.

**Each Round follows this sequence:**

**Step 1: Scenario Introduction**

- Forecast board displays the scenario context
- Mika says: "Here's today's situation to forecast!"
- Screen shows illustrated scenario with text description
- Example: "Jamie is about to give a presentation in front of the whole class"
- Weather background shifts to match scenario mood (e.g., cloudy sky for challenging situation)

**Step 2: Feeling Options Presented**

- Three feeling cards appear below the scenario, each showing:
  - Feeling name
  - Emoji/face icon
  - Weather symbol (connecting to weather metaphor)
- Mika says: "These are the three feelings that happened in this story. But what order did they happen in?"
- Example feelings shown: Nervous, Proud, Excited
- All three feelings are displayed simultaneously but not yet in sequence slots

**Step 3: Sequence Question - FIRST Feeling**

- The three forecast slots (START → MIDDLE → END) pulse on the board
- The START slot glows and pulses
- Mika says: "Which feeling came FIRST at the start of the situation?"
- Prompt: "Click 1, 2, or 3 to choose the FIRST feeling."
- Students see:
  - Button 1: \[Feeling option A\]
  - Button 2: \[Feeling option B\]
  - Button 3: \[Feeling option C\]
- All students vote simultaneously using clickers
- Timer: 10 seconds (visual countdown bar)

**Step 4: First Feeling Placement**

- Correct answer appears in the START slot with animation
- If incorrect choice was popular, brief neutral feedback: "Many of us chose \[X\], but the story started with \[correct feeling\]."
- Mika says: "Yes! At the START, \[feeling name\]. \[Brief explanation of why-e.g., 'Jamie felt nervous before presenting'\]."

**Step 5: Sequence Question - MIDDLE Feeling**

- The MIDDLE slot now glows and pulses
- Remaining two feelings still displayed as options
- Mika says: "The feeling changed! Which feeling came NEXT in the middle?"
- Prompt: "Click 1 or 2 to choose the MIDDLE feeling."
- Students see:
  - Button 1: \[Remaining feeling option A\]
  - Button 2: \[Remaining feeling option B\]
- All students vote simultaneously
- Timer: 10 seconds

**Step 6: Middle Feeling Placement**

- Correct answer appears in the MIDDLE slot with animation
- Mika says: "Right! In the MIDDLE, \[feeling name\]. \[Brief explanation-e.g., 'While presenting, Jamie started feeling excited'\]."

**Step 7: Final Feeling Confirmation**

- The last remaining feeling automatically fills the END slot
- Mika says: "And at the END, \[feeling name\]! \[Brief explanation-e.g., 'After finishing, Jamie felt proud'\]."
- Complete sequence now displayed: START → MIDDLE → END with all three feelings in order
- Weather animation plays across the slots showing transition (e.g., stormy → partly cloudy → sunny)

**Step 8: Reflection & Transition**

- Mika says: "Notice how the feelings changed over time? \[Key insight for that scenario-e.g., 'Nervous feelings don't last forever-they can change to excited and then proud'\]."
- Brief pause (3 seconds) showing complete sequence
- Progress updates: "Forecasts Completed: 1/6" → "2/6" etc.
- Stars awarded based on correct answers (1 star if both first and middle selections were correct, 0.5 stars if only one correct)
- Board clears and next scenario begins

**Six Rounds Content:**

**Round 1: School Presentation**

- **Scenario:** "Jamie is about to give a presentation in front of the whole class. The presentation happens. Jamie finishes and sits down."
- **Illustration:** Child standing in front of class, then presenting, then sitting with smile
- **Three feelings:** Nervous / Excited / Proud
- **Correct sequence:**
  - START: Nervous (before presenting)
  - MIDDLE: Excited (during presenting - having fun)
  - END: Proud (after finishing successfully)
- **Mika's insight:** "Nervous feelings at the start changed to excited, then proud! Feelings moved through time like weather changing."

**Round 2: Lost Toy**

- **Scenario:** "Alex can't find his favorite toy anywhere. He looks and looks. Then Mom helps him find it under the bed!"
- **Illustration:** Child searching worried, then discovering toy, then hugging toy
- **Three feelings:** Worried / Relieved / Happy
- **Correct sequence:**
  - START: Worried (can't find toy)
  - MIDDLE: Relieved (found it!)
  - END: Happy (has toy back)
- **Mika's insight:** "Worried changed to relieved, then to happy. The uncomfortable feeling didn't last-it passed when the situation changed!"

**Round 3: Playground Conflict**

- **Scenario:** "Someone knocked down Maya's sand castle at the playground. Maya told them how she felt. They said sorry and helped rebuild it."
- **Illustration:** Knocked castle, child talking, children building together
- **Three feelings:** Angry / Heard / Grateful
- **Correct sequence:**
  - START: Angry (castle destroyed - feels unfair)
  - MIDDLE: Heard (expressed feelings, got apology)
  - END: Grateful (working together, problem solved)
- **Mika's insight:** "Angry feelings can change when we communicate and when situations get better. The anger didn't stay forever!"

**Round 4: Thunderstorm at Night**

- **Scenario:** "Sam hears loud thunder and sees lightning at night. The storm continues for a while. Eventually the storm passes and the sun comes out."
- **Illustration:** Child in bed during storm, storm continuing, sunshine through window
- **Three feelings:** Scared / Still Scared / Calm
- **Correct sequence:**
  - START: Scared (storm starts)
  - MIDDLE: Still Scared (storm continuing - showing feelings can last different lengths)
  - END: Calm (storm over, danger passed)
- **Mika's insight:** "Sometimes feelings take longer to change. Sam stayed scared for a while, and that's okay. But even those feelings eventually changed to calm."

**Round 5: Birthday Party**

- **Scenario:** "It's party day! Riley has been waiting all week. The party happens and is so much fun. The party ends and everyone goes home."
- **Illustration:** Child waiting at door, party with friends, party over
- **Three feelings:** Excited / Happy / Tired
- **Correct sequence:**
  - START: Excited (anticipation before party)
  - MIDDLE: Happy (during fun party)
  - END: Tired (after lots of activity)
- **Mika's insight:** "Even good feelings like excited and happy change over time. Tired came at the end, and that's natural after using lots of energy!"

**Round 6: Learning Something New**

- **Scenario:** "Jordan tries to ride a bike for the first time and keeps falling. After practice, Jordan starts to get it. Finally, Jordan rides without falling!"
- **Illustration:** Child falling off bike, wobbling on bike, riding successfully
- **Three feelings:** Frustrated / Determined / Proud
- **Correct sequence:**
  - START: Frustrated (keeps falling - feels hard)
  - MIDDLE: Determined (keeps trying - not giving up)
  - END: Proud (success!)
- **Mika's insight:** "Frustrated feelings changed to determined, then to proud. Feelings shift as we learn and grow. The tricky feeling at the start didn't stop the proud feeling at the end!"

### Scoring

**Points System:**

- Both START and MIDDLE selections correct: **1 full star** per round
- Only one selection correct (either START or MIDDLE): **0.5 stars** per round
- Both selections incorrect: **0 stars** (but immediate feedback shows correct sequence)
- Maximum possible: **6 stars total** (1 per round × 6 rounds)

**Forecast Accuracy Levels:**

- 5-6 stars: "Master Feeling Forecaster" (gold weather badge)
- 3-4 stars: "Feeling Forecaster" (silver weather badge)
- 1-2 stars: "Forecaster in Training" (bronze weather badge)

**No penalties:** Incorrect sequencing provides immediate corrective feedback showing the right order with explanation. No points subtracted. This maintains psychological safety while teaching temporal patterns.

**Visual feedback:**

- Stars accumulate in forecast accuracy meter at top
- Each completed sequence shows weather transition animation reinforcing change
- Progress tracker shows rounds completed

### Win Condition

**Completion:** Game is complete when all 6 feeling sequences have been forecasted (all 6 rounds played).

**Success Screen:**

- Split-screen display showing all 6 completed sequences in miniature
- Mika says: "Forecast complete! You tracked feelings changing over time in 6 different situations. Now you know: feelings are temporary-they always change, just like weather!"
- Badge displayed based on stars earned
- Star count: "\[X\]/6 forecast sequences correctly predicted"
- Neutral acknowledgment: "You sequenced \[X\] feeling changes from start to finish."

**Key Learning Summary Panel:**

- Title: "What We Discovered About Changing Feelings"
- Three key insights displayed:
  - "Feelings change over time-they don't stay the same forever"
  - "Uncomfortable feelings (nervous, worried, angry, scared, frustrated) can change to better feelings"
  - "Different people's feelings change at different speeds-some quick, some slower-both are normal"
- Weather transition animation plays: stormy → cloudy → partly cloudy → sunny

**Pattern Recognition Element:**

- Mika says: "Did you notice? In every story, feelings changed! That's how feelings work. They're temporary, like weather passing through."

**Return Navigation:**

- "Return to the park" button → links to lesson-06.03.html
- Button is keyboard-focusable (tab-accessible)

### Continuity Note

**Links to Prior Learning:** Builds on Lessons 1-2 by adding the temporal dimension. Students learned what feelings are (L1: information messengers) and where they appear (L2: body signals). Now they learn when and how feelings shift-completing the understanding of feelings as observable, embodied, and dynamic phenomena.

**Links to Future Learning:** Prepares for Lesson 4 (Everyone Has Feelings) by establishing that feelings follow patterns that can be observed across different people and situations. Understanding that feelings change (L3) helps students recognize that while expressions may look different (L4), the underlying pattern of emotional change is universal.

## In-Class-Game 6D – Expression Explorer

**Lesson 4: Everyone Has Feelings**

**(Even When They Look Different)**

### Lesson Link & Learning Objective

Recognize that all people experience feelings, even when their expressions look different; distinguish between internal feelings (universal) and external expressions (varied) by providing examples (e.g., "Some people cry when sad; others go quiet"); identify at least two different ways the same feeling might be expressed by different people or in different cultures; apply curiosity by asking "What might that person be feeling?" when observing behavior rather than assuming they know.

### Game File Name: icg-06.04-game01.html

### Game Title: ****Expression Explorer****

### **Game Format**: Guess the Ending  

****Justification:**** This format has 0 uses across all units (virgin format). Adapted here as "Guess the Hidden Feeling," this format is ideal for teaching that feelings and expressions can differ because it requires students to observe external behavior (expression) and predict the internal state (feeling) before the reveal. The prediction-then-reveal mechanic models the scientific practice of forming hypotheses based on observation, then testing those hypotheses-reinforcing that we cannot always know what someone feels just by looking at them. This builds empathy and curiosity while demonstrating that the same internal feeling can have multiple valid external expressions. The format is click-compatible, age-appropriate, and supports the psychology-as-science framework by treating emotional observation as an empirical skill requiring careful attention and openness to surprise.

### **Purpose**: Students practice distinguishing between internal feelings (which are universal) and external expressions (which vary between individuals and cultures) by observing different characters showing the same feeling in different ways. They learn to wonder "What might this person be feeling?" rather than assume, building empathy and scientific curiosity about human emotional diversity

### **Lesson Arc Location**: Practice B (approximately 25-27 minutes into the 45-minute lesson). After Explore A (Feelings Can Look Different - expression variety cards), Practice A (Role-Play of different expressions), Explore B (Video showing cultural diversity), before Explore C (Psychology Experiment - "Can You Guess?" guessing game), before In-Class Quiz, before Reflection

****Rationale**:** This placement is pedagogically optimal because students have already:

- Seen that the same feeling can look different through expression variety cards showing 4 ways to express each feeling (Explore A)
- Physically acted out different expressions of the same feeling through role-play, experiencing firsthand how expression varies (Practice A)
- Watched video showing diverse cultural expressions of feelings (Explore B)

The game serves as synthesis and application-taking the observational learning from cards, the kinesthetic learning from role-play, and the cultural awareness from video, then applying all three to predict feelings from varied expressions. The "guess before reveal" mechanic reinforces the lesson's core message: we must wonder and stay curious because we cannot always know someone's internal state from their external behavior. Placing it before the physical experiment allows students to practice observation and prediction in the game, then apply those same skills to live classroom interactions. The quiz and reflection then consolidate understanding across all modalities.

### Setup

**Starting Screen:**

- **Background:** World map with gentle dots showing various locations, transformed into an observation laboratory setting with screens showing different children
- **Character:** Explorer Eli (friendly cartoon character wearing explorer vest with binoculars around neck, holding observation journal) appears on left side
- **Eli says:** "Welcome, Feeling Explorers! All people have feelings, but we show them in different ways. Let's practice being curious observers. Can you guess what people are feeling inside, even when they express it differently on the outside?"
- **Visual elements:**
  - Large observation screen (center) currently showing world map background
  - "Explorer's Discovery Log" notebook graphic (top left)
  - Progress tracker (top right): "Expressions Explored: 0/6"
  - Curiosity compass icon (animated, pointing in different directions)
- **UI elements:**
  - "Begin Exploring" button (center bottom)
  - Clicker instruction icon showing buttons 1-4
  - Small "Remember" note: "Same feeling inside, different expression outside!"

**First Interaction:** Student clicks "Begin Exploring" button (or presses any clicker button) to begin Round 1.

### Play

**Round Structure:** The game consists of 6 rounds. Each round shows 2-3 characters expressing the same internal feeling in visibly different ways. Students observe the expressions, predict what internal feeling all characters share, then see the reveal confirming that different expressions can reflect the same underlying emotion.

**Each Round follows this sequence:**

**Step 1: Expression Observation Setup**

- Eli says: "Let's observe some people carefully!"
- Observation screen shows 2-3 characters side-by-side (numbered 1, 2, and sometimes 3)
- Each character displays distinct external behavior/expression
- Characters are diverse in appearance (different skin tones, cultural dress, settings)
- No feeling labels shown yet-only observable behavior

**Step 2: Behavior Description**

- Text appears below each character describing what can be observed externally:
  - Character 1: \[Observable behavior description\]
  - Character 2: \[Different observable behavior description\]
  - Character 3: \[Different observable behavior description\] (if applicable)
- Example:
  - Character 1: "Tears rolling down cheeks, frowning"
  - Character 2: "Sitting alone quietly, looking down"
  - Character 3: "Drawing by themselves, not talking"
- Eli says: "Look at how differently these people are acting. But here's the question..."

**Step 3: Curiosity Question**

- Eli says: "What feeling do you think ALL of these people share inside, even though they're showing it in different ways?"
- Screen displays the curiosity prompt: "What might they all be feeling inside?"
- Important framing: "We can't be 100% sure just by looking, but we can make a careful guess!"

**Step 4: Prediction Vote**

- Four feeling options appear with clicker numbers:
  - Button 1: \[Correct shared feeling\]
  - Button 2: \[Plausible distractor\]
  - Button 3: \[Plausible distractor\]
  - Button 4: \[Plausible distractor\]
- Prompt: "What internal feeling do ALL these people share? Click 1, 2, 3, or 4."
- All students vote simultaneously using clickers
- Timer: 12 seconds (visual countdown bar)
- During countdown, characters' expressions remain visible for continued observation

**Step 5: Reveal & Discovery**

- Correct answer highlights with green glow
- Each character's image gains a small thought bubble or heart icon showing the shared feeling emoji
- Eli says: "Yes! They all feel \[feeling name\] inside. But notice-they showed it in very different ways on the outside!"
- Brief animation: each character's expression is highlighted in sequence with text appearing:
  - "Character 1 showed \[feeling\] by \[behavior\]"
  - "Character 2 showed \[feeling\] by \[behavior\]"
  - "Character 3 showed \[feeling\] by \[behavior\]"

**Step 6: Key Learning Moment**

- Eli provides insight specific to that round's examples:
  - "Same feeling inside, different expressions outside. That's normal!"
  - OR "Different people, different families, different cultures-all have their own ways of showing feelings"
  - OR "We can't always tell what someone is feeling just by looking. That's why we stay curious!"
- A note is added to the "Explorer's Discovery Log" showing the feeling and number of expression variations observed

**Step 7: Next Round Transition**

- Progress updates: "Expressions Explored: 1/6" → "2/6" etc.
- Eli says: "Let's explore another feeling and see how expressions can vary!"
- After 2-second pause, next round begins

**Six Rounds Content:**

**Round 1: Sad**

- **Characters shown (3):**
  - Character 1: Child with tears streaming down face, frowning deeply, hands covering eyes
  - Character 2: Child sitting alone at table, looking down at floor quietly, flat expression
  - Character 3: Child curled up on couch with blanket, facing away from others
- **Observable behaviors:**
  - "Crying with tears" / "Sitting quietly alone" / "Curled up away from others"
- **Feeling options:** 1-Sad ✓ / 2-Angry / 3-Scared / 4-Excited
- **Eli's insight:** "All three feel sad inside. Some people cry loudly when sad, some get very quiet, and some want to be alone. All are normal ways to show sadness."

**Round 2: Happy**

- **Characters shown (3):**
  - Character 1: Child jumping high with arms raised, huge smile, shouting
  - Character 2: Child sitting with small gentle smile, hands folded, calm posture
  - Character 3: Child hugging someone tightly, closed eyes, peaceful expression
- **Observable behaviors:**
  - "Jumping and shouting" / "Sitting with small smile" / "Giving a quiet hug"
- **Feeling options:** 1-Scared / 2-Happy ✓ / 3-Angry / 4-Nervous
- **Eli's insight:** "All three feel happy inside! Some people show happiness with big energy and noise. Others show it quietly with a small smile or gentle hug. Both are real happiness!"

**Round 3: Angry**

- **Characters shown (2):**
  - Character 1: Child with red face, clenched fists, yelling with mouth wide open
  - Character 2: Child with arms crossed tightly, turned away from others, silent with furrowed brow
- **Observable behaviors:**
  - "Yelling with clenched fists" / "Silent, turned away, arms crossed"
- **Feeling options:** 1-Happy / 2-Sad / 3-Angry ✓ / 4-Excited
- **Eli's insight:** "Both feel angry inside. One person shows anger with loud words and tense body. The other shows anger by being very quiet and turning away. Same feeling, different expression!"

**Round 4: Nervous**

- **Characters shown (3):**
  - Character 1: Child fidgeting with hands, pacing back and forth, biting lip
  - Character 2: Child standing very still and frozen, wide eyes, not moving at all
  - Character 3: Child talking very fast and asking lots of questions continuously
- **Observable behaviors:**
  - "Fidgeting and pacing" / "Standing completely still" / "Talking very fast"
- **Feeling options:** 1-Nervous ✓ / 2-Happy / 3-Angry / 4-Tired
- **Eli's insight:** "All three feel nervous inside! Some people move a lot when nervous, some freeze and can't move, and some talk more than usual. Our bodies react differently, but the feeling inside is the same."

**Round 5: Excited**

- **Characters shown (3):**
  - Character 1: Child bouncing up and down, waving arms, talking loudly and quickly
  - Character 2: Child with big smile but standing still, clapping hands softly
  - Character 3: Child giggling quietly while sitting, rocking slightly, sparkly eyes
- **Observable behaviors:**
  - "Bouncing and talking loudly" / "Standing still, soft clapping" / "Sitting quietly, giggling"
- **Feeling options:** 1-Scared / 2-Sad / 3-Excited ✓ / 4-Worried
- **Eli's insight:** "They all feel excited inside! In some cultures or families, people show excitement with big movements and loud voices. In others, excitement is shown more quietly. All are real excitement!"

**Round 6: Scared**

- **Characters shown (2):**
  - Character 1: Child crying with visible tears, reaching for adult, shaking
  - Character 2: Child with no tears, standing quietly, eyes wide, holding breath
- **Observable behaviors:**
  - "Crying and reaching for help" / "Quiet, wide eyes, frozen"
- **Feeling options:** 1-Happy / 2-Angry / 3-Scared ✓ / 4-Excited
- **Eli's insight:** "Both feel scared inside. Some people cry when scared and seek comfort. Others don't cry but freeze very still. We can't always tell if someone is scared just by looking-that's why we ask 'What might they be feeling?' instead of assuming we know."

### Scoring

**Points System:**

- Correct feeling identification: **1 star** per round
- Maximum possible: **6 stars total** (1 per round × 6 rounds)

**Discovery Log Progress:**

- Each correct answer adds an entry to Explorer's Discovery Log
- Log entry shows: \[Feeling name\] + \[Number of different expressions observed\]
- By game end, log shows 6 feelings with expression variety data

**Curiosity Badge System:**

- 5-6 stars: "Master Expression Explorer" (gold badge with binoculars)
- 3-4 stars: "Expression Explorer" (silver badge)
- 1-2 stars: "Beginning Explorer" (bronze badge)

**No penalties:** Incorrect predictions provide immediate feedback showing the correct shared feeling with explanation of why external expressions differed. No points subtracted. This maintains psychological safety and reinforces that predicting feelings requires careful observation and openness to being surprised.

**Visual feedback:**

- Stars appear in collection area at top
- Discovery Log gains illustrated entries as rounds complete
- Progress tracker updates

  - "Same feeling can look very different on the outside" - masks/faces icon
  - "We can't always know what someone feels just by looking-stay curious!" - question mark icon

**Empathy Message:**

- Eli says: "Remember: When you see someone acting in a way you don't understand, instead of thinking 'That's weird,' try thinking 'I wonder what they're feeling? Let me stay curious!' This is how we understand each other better."

**Expression Gallery:**

- Quick visual recap showing all observed expression variations
- Text: "We saw \[X total\] different ways to express feelings today!"

### Continuity Note

**Links to Prior Learning:** Completes the unit arc by zooming from individual experience (L1: feelings as messages, L2: body signals, L3: feelings change) to universal-yet-diverse human experience. Students now understand feelings as: (1) information systems that (2) manifest physically and (3) change over time, while also (4) being expressed differently across individuals and cultures. This final layer builds empathy through scientific observation of human diversity.

**Links to Future Learning:** Prepares for future units exploring social dynamics and perspective-taking by establishing that understanding others requires curiosity and observation rather than assumption. The skill of wondering "What might they be feeling?" becomes foundational for all social-emotional learning grounded in psychology science.
