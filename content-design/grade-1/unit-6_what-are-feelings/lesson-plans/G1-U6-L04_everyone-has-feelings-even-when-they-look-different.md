# Lesson 4: Everyone Has Feelings (Even When They Look Different)

## Lesson Objective
Students will recognise that all people experience feelings but that expressions of those feelings can look different.  
They will practise curiosity about others’ inner experiences without assuming, and develop empathy by acknowledging that different expressions are all valid ways of showing emotion.

---

## Warm-Up (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *Feeling the Same, Showing Different*  

Display two images:  
- one child laughing and jumping,  
- one child sitting quietly and smiling.  

Ask:  
> “Are both of these children happy?”

Discuss:  
> “The first child is laughing loudly. The second is quiet and still.  
> They might both be happy — just showing it differently!  
> Feelings are universal — everyone has them — but how we show them is personal.”

Introduce the big idea:  
> “Feelings are shared by all humans, but expression depends on personality, culture, and context.”

## Explore + Practice (30 minutes)

### Explore A: Feelings Can Look Different (8 minutes)

**Materials:** Hard copy – Expression Variety Card Set (images showing the same feeling expressed in different ways)

Show 4 images for *sadness*:  
1. Crying with tears and frown  
2. Quiet, looking down  
3. Lying down and not moving  
4. Drawing alone quietly  

Ask:  
- “Do all of these show sadness?”  
- “How are they different?”  
- “Which one looks most like you when you’re sad?”

Repeat with 2–3 more feelings (happy, angry, scared).  
Conclude:  
> “Our bodies, families, and cultures differ, so how we show feelings differs too.  
> And that’s perfectly normal.”

---

### Practice A: Role-Play – Different Ways to Express the Same Feeling (8 minutes)

**Materials:** Open classroom space  

Divide students into small groups. Assign each group a feeling (happy, sad, angry, scared).  
Each group acts out *three different ways* someone might show that feeling.

**Example (Happy):**  
- Child 1 jumps and shouts.  
- Child 2 smiles quietly to themselves.  
- Child 3 hugs a friend.  

After each group performs, ask:  
> “Was that the same feeling? How did they show it differently?”

**Key insight:** Feelings can look different while meaning the same thing.

### Practice B: Short Psychology Video – “Different People, Different Feelings” (2 minutes)

**Title:** *Turning Red (Pixar clip)* or *All Kinds of Families*  
**Link:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQwXGk9L4Gc  
*(Alternative: search “cultural differences emotions children” or “different ways people show feelings.”)*  

**Note:** This video is indicative only. In the full MindMaster version, a modified or copyright-free video will be produced or featured to illustrate the same concept.

After watching, ask:
- “How did different characters show their feelings?”
- “Were they the same?”
- “Why might people show feelings differently?”

---

### Practice C: Psychology Experiment – “Can You Guess?” (In-Class)

**Objective:** Demonstrate that the same feeling can be expressed in different ways.  

**Steps:**
1. One child volunteers to act out a feeling (happy, sad, angry, scared) using only body and face—no words.  
2. The rest of the class guesses what feeling it might be.  
3. After guessing, ask: “Did everyone guess the same? Why might there be different guesses?”  
4. Reveal the real feeling. Ask: “How did you show it? Did it look like how others show it?”  
5. Repeat with 2–3 more volunteers.  

**Key insight:** Feelings are universal, but expressions are unique to each person.

### Practice D: MindMaster Game – “Feelings Detective: Look Beyond Behaviour” (10 minutes)

**Game Format:** Match Character to Scenario (Observation Challenge)

**Game Flow:**
1. **Setup:** Screen shows 4 character behaviours (images + descriptions).  
2. **Scenarios:**  
   - “Alex is laughing really loud and jumping.”  
     Options: Nervous / Happy / Sad → ✅ Happy (*but note: some people laugh when nervous!*)  
   - “Zoe is sitting alone, not talking to anyone.”  
     Options: Angry / Happy / Sad or Shy → ✅ Sad or Shy (*different people show feelings differently!*)  
   - “Jordan’s face is red and fists are clenched.”  
     Options: Excited / Angry / Scared → ✅ Angry (*could also be very excited!*)  
   - “Sam is quiet, eyes wide, stepped back.”  
     Options: Excited / Surprised / Happy → ✅ Scared or Surprised (*both are valid interpretations!*)  
3. **Play:** Students select the feeling that might fit best.  
4. **Feedback:** Each round shows the explanation: “This behaviour might show ___, but everyone is different.”  
5. **Scoring:** +1 per completed round.  
6. **Win Condition:** Complete all 4 = “You’re a Feelings Detective — respectful and curious!”  
7. **Timing:** After Role-Play (Practice A).  

**Purpose:** Teaches observation and empathy without assuming others’ feelings.

**Presentation:** One statement per screen (buttons 1–2 for True/False).  
**Feedback:** After each, an explanation appears (e.g., *“Right! People express feelings in many ways depending on their culture or personality.”*)  
**Scoring:** +1 per correct.  
**Win Condition:** 4/4 = “You Understand Feelings Are Universal and Expressions Are Diverse!”  
**Timing:** After video and game.

## Reflection (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *MindMaster Reflection – How Do You Show Feelings?*  

**Flow:**  
1. Three reflection prompts appear on screen.  
   - “When you’re sad, how do you usually show it?”  
     Options: Cry / Go quiet / Draw alone / Something else  
   - “Have you noticed someone showing a feeling differently than you would?”  
     Options: Yes / No / Not sure  
   - “Is it okay for people to show feelings in different ways?”  
     Options: Yes / No  
2. Students select their responses via clickers.  
3. Display class results: “Look how many different ways our class shows feelings — and that’s beautiful!”

**Teacher note:** Affirm diversity of expression and empathy as strengths.

## Home Prep (5 minutes)

**Teacher Guidance:**  
> “Tonight, notice how your family members show their feelings.  
> Does your grown-up show happiness the same way you do?  
> Does your sibling show anger the same way you do?  
> Notice the differences — that’s what makes people unique!  

> On MindMaster, you’ll play *Feelings Detectives* — a game that helps you think about what others might be feeling.  
> Remember, we can wonder about others’ feelings without being sure, and that’s okay.”

## Connection to Unit Arc
Lesson 4 completes the **“What Are Feelings?”** unit.  
Lessons 1–3 built understanding that feelings are:
1. **Messages** (Lesson 1)  
2. **Embodied** (Lesson 2)  
3. **Changeable** (Lesson 3)  

This final lesson expands perspective to the **social and cultural dimension** — feelings are universal, yet expression is diverse.  
By normalising these differences, children strengthen empathy, patience, and respect for others’ emotional experiences.
