# Lesson 3: Feelings Change (And That’s Normal)

## Lesson Objective
Students will learn that feelings are temporary and change over time, like the weather.  
They will identify examples of how feelings shift in stories and experiences, recognise that people move through feelings at different speeds, and apply the understanding that uncomfortable feelings will eventually pass—building resilience.

---

## Warm-Up (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *Weather and Feelings Connection*  

Look outside or discuss the weather:  
> “This morning it was sunny. Now it’s cloudy. Later it might rain, and tomorrow it could be sunny again. Weather changes, right?”  

Introduce the key idea:  
> “Feelings change just like the weather. You might feel calm now, excited at recess, and tired after lunch. Feelings come and go. That’s normal.”

Ask: “What feeling did you have this morning? What feeling do you have now? It changed, didn’t it?”

## Explore + Practice (30 minutes)

### Explore A: Story of Changing Feelings (7 minutes)
**Materials:** Hard copy – *Feelings Change Story Cards* or short teacher-told stories

Tell or read a short story where a character experiences multiple feelings:

> “Emma felt nervous before her dance show. Her heart was beating fast.  
> When the music started, her nervousness changed into excitement.  
> She danced and had so much fun. After the show, she felt tired but proud.”

Display or draw a simple timeline:
- Start → *Nervous*  
- Middle → *Excited*  
- End → *Tired & Proud*

Ask:
- “What feelings did Emma have?”
- “Did they stay the same the whole time?”
- “What changed her feelings?”

Repeat with another short story (e.g., a toy breaking → sadness → comfort → feeling better).

**Teaching note:** Emphasise that feelings move and evolve naturally as situations change.

---

### Practice A: Feelings Change Timeline Activity (8 minutes)

**Materials:** Hard copy – *My Feelings Timeline* worksheet (3–4 boxes)  

Students choose a simple experience (e.g., *Waiting for recess*, *Learning something new*, *Playing with a friend*).  
They draw or write the feelings they had at the start, middle, and end.  

Teacher circulates and asks:  
> “What feeling started? What changed? Why did it change?”  

**Learning goal:** Students see that feelings are dynamic and situational, not permanent.

### Practice D: Psychology Experiment – “How Long Does the Feeling Last?” (via MindMaster)

**Objective:** Show that feelings fade at different speeds for different people.  

**Test Name:** *Feelings Speed Test*

**Steps:**
1. **Setup:** Students view 3 scenarios where a character feels uncomfortable.  
2. **Scenarios:**  
   - “Alex felt sad when his friend went home. It took [Quick / Medium / Slow] for him to feel better.”  
   - “Maya felt angry when her block tower fell. It took [Quick / Medium / Slow] for her to calm down.”  
   - “Sam felt scared during a thunderstorm. It took [Quick / Medium / Slow] for him to feel safe again.”  
3. **Play:** Students select Quick / Medium / Slow using clickers (buttons 1–3).  
4. **Feedback:** Reveal that people feel and recover at different speeds — both are normal.  
5. **Scoring:** No right or wrong answers; participation completion = success.  
6. **Win Condition:** “You understand feelings change differently for everyone!”

**Teaching note:** This test emphasises that variation is normal and time helps feelings pass.

### Practice E: MindMaster Game – “Feelings Weather Forecast” (6 minutes)

**Game Format:** Sequence Builder (Drag or Select Images in Order)

**Game Flow:**
1. **Setup:** Screen shows “weather forecast” metaphor — each weather icon represents a feeling.  
   - Sunny = Happy  
   - Cloudy = Worried  
   - Rainy = Sad  
   - Rainbow = Calm / Hopeful
2. **Play:** Students use clickers to arrange feelings in logical time order.  
   - Example Scenarios:  
     - “Start excited → become worried → end calm.”  
     - “Start sad → become hopeful → end happy.”  
     - “Start angry → become calm → end okay.”  
3. **Scoring:** +1 point per correct sequence.  
4. **Win Condition:** All 3 correct = “Feelings Meteorologist Complete!”  
5. **Timing:** After Explore A (story).  

**Purpose:** Reinforces the concept of emotional progression visually and metaphorically.

## Reflection (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *Class Discussion – Feelings Will Pass*  

Ask:
1. “Can you remember a time you felt sad, angry, scared, or frustrated?”  
2. “How long did that feeling last?”  
3. “What helped it change?”  
4. “Do you think that feeling will come back?” (Yes, sometimes—but it won’t last forever.)

Conclude:
> “Uncomfortable feelings are normal. They come and go.  
> Even big feelings pass. That’s why we can have hope.”

---

## Home Prep (5 minutes)

**Teacher Guidance:**  
> “Tonight, notice how your feelings change during the day — morning, afternoon, evening.  
> Do they stay the same or move around?  
> On MindMaster, you’ll play *Feelings Weather* — a game where feelings move like clouds across the sky.  
> You’ll see feelings drift and predict what comes next!”

---

## Connection to Unit Arc
Lesson 3 expands understanding from *what* and *where* feelings are to *how they behave over time*.  
Students learn that:
- Feelings are temporary, not fixed.  
- Everyone’s feelings change at different speeds.  
- Uncomfortable feelings will pass.  

This builds emotional resilience and prepares students for Lesson 4, which broadens perspective to the universality and diversity of human expression.
