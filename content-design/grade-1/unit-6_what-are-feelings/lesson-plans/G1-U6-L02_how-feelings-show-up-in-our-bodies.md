# Lesson 2: How Feelings Show Up in Our Bodies

## Lesson Objective
Students will learn that feelings are not only in the mind but also create physical sensations in the body.  
They will locate where specific feelings appear in their bodies, discover that while many people share common physical cues, each person’s signals can be unique, and practise body awareness as a tool for noticing feelings early.

## Warm-Up (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *Body Scan – Quick Check*  

Guide a 1-minute body scan:  
> “Close your eyes. Notice your body right now. Is your stomach calm or wiggly? Are your shoulders tight or loose? Are your fists clenched or open?”  

Ask: “What did you notice?” Collect a few responses.  
Introduce:  
> “Our bodies are always sending us signals. When we have a feeling, our body shows it.  
> It’s like our body is a feeling messenger too!”

---

## Explore + Practice (30 minutes)

### Explore A: Feelings in the Body – Teacher Modelling (8 minutes)
**Materials:** Hard copy – Body Outline Poster (large, visible to all)

Introduce:  
> “Feelings live in our minds, but they also show up in our bodies.  
> When I feel scared, my heart beats fast. When I feel angry, my fists might clench.  
> Let’s explore this together.”

Work through three common feelings with students:

- **Scared / Worried:** “Where do you feel it?”  
  (Stomach butterflies, heart racing, tight shoulders, sweaty hands)  
- **Angry:** “Where do you feel it?”  
  (Face hot, fists clenched, jaw tight, chest tight)  
- **Happy / Excited:** “Where do you feel it?”  
  (Light, bouncy, chest warm, smile on face)

Ask children to point to or name the body location.  
Mark it on the body outline poster with the feeling word.  

**Pedagogy note:** Different people might feel these in slightly different places. That’s normal. Our bodies are unique messengers.

### Practice A: Feelings Body Map Activity (8 minutes)
**Materials:** Individual Body Outline Worksheets; coloured markers or crayons  

Distribute one worksheet per student.  
Call out a feeling (e.g., *Scared*). Students colour or mark where they feel it in their body.  
Repeat with 3–4 feelings (happy, sad, angry, excited).  

Circulate and ask: “Where did you put that? What does it feel like there?”  
Encourage descriptive vocabulary (warm, tight, fluttery, heavy).  

**Learning goal:** Build awareness of body-feeling connection and self-observation.

---

### Practice B: Psychology Experiment – “Where’s the Feeling?” (In-Class)
**Objective:** Show that feelings appear as physical signals, and everyone’s signals are unique.

**Steps:**
1. Call out a feeling name (e.g., *Happy!*).  
2. Children have 5 seconds to point to or touch where they feel it in their body.  
3. Ask 3–4 children to share where they pointed and describe the sensation.  
4. Repeat with 3–4 feelings (sad, scared, angry, excited).  
5. Discuss: “Did everyone point to the same place? Why might that be different?”  

**Key insight:** While many children point to the chest or stomach for similar feelings, variation is normal. This shows individuality in bodily experience.

### Practice C: Short Psychology Video – Body Signals in Action (2 minutes)
**Title:** “Bluey: The Sleepover” or similar short clip showing visible emotion body reactions  
**Link:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1ggJwbHt2I  
*(Alternative: search “kids show emotion body reaction”)*  

**Note:** This video is indicative only. In the full MindMaster version, a modified or copyright-free video will be produced or featured to illustrate the same concept.

**Purpose:** Observe how characters’ bodies show feelings through posture, facial expression, and movement.  
**Timing:** After Practice B.

---

### Practice D: MindMaster Game – “Match Feelings to Body Signals” (10 minutes)
**Game Format:** Matching Pairs (Memory Flip Game)

**Game Flow:**
1. **Setup:** 12 cards face-down in a 3×4 grid on screen (6 feelings + 6 body signals).  
   | Feeling | Body Signal |
   |----------|-------------|
   | Happy | Warm chest, smiling face |
   | Scared | Butterflies in stomach |
   | Angry | Hot face, clenched fists |
   | Sad | Heavy chest, quiet body |
   | Excited | Bouncy energy, can’t sit still |
   | Surprised | Open mouth, wide eyes |
2. **Play:** Student uses clicker to flip two cards and find matches.  
3. **Scoring:** +1 point per correct pair.  
4. **Win Condition:** Match all 6 pairs = “Body Signals Expert!”  
5. **Timing:** After Practice A (Body Map).  

**Purpose:** Reinforces the mind-body connection through play.

## Reflection (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *MindMaster Reflection – Where Do You Feel It?*  

**Flow:**
1. Screen shows three feeling scenarios.  
   - *“You’re about to give a show-and-tell. Where do you feel nervous?”*  
   - *“You just won a game! Where do you feel excited?”*  
   - *“You heard a scary sound. Where do you feel scared?”*  
2. Students choose a body part (buttons 1–4): stomach / chest / face / shoulders.  
3. Teacher discusses results: “Look, some of us felt it in the stomach, some in the chest. Both are right!”  

**Goal:** Reinforce self-observation and acceptance of individual differences.

## Home Prep (5 minutes)

**Teacher Guidance:**  
> “Tonight, practise noticing feelings in your body.  
> If you feel happy, excited, or worried, stop and check: *Where do you feel it?*  
> On MindMaster, play *Body Signals* — you’ll see a feeling and pick where it shows up in your body.  
> There are no right or wrong answers — we all have unique bodies!”

## Connection to Unit Arc
Lesson 2 builds directly on Lesson 1’s concept that **feelings are messengers**.  
Now students see that every feeling has two parts:  
- a **mental message** (what it tells us), and  
- a **physical signal** (where we feel it).  

Lesson 3 will explore how feelings **change over time**, adding the temporal dimension of emotional understanding.
