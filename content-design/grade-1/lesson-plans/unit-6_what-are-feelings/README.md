# Grade 1 · Unit 6 — What Are Feelings?

**Purpose**  
This unit introduces **feelings as the mind’s messenger system** — signals that tell us what matters, help us respond to situations, and connect us with others.  
After exploring how imagination lets us understand other minds, students now discover that feelings are **shared by all people yet expressed in unique ways**.  
Through observation, experiments, and play, children learn that:

- Feelings are **information**, not good or bad — they send messages about our needs and values.  
- Feelings **show up in the body** through sensations like a racing heart or a calm chest.  
- Feelings **change over time**, just like weather.  
- Everyone **expresses feelings differently**, and that diversity is normal and valuable.  

By understanding feelings scientifically, students gain curiosity and confidence in managing emotions — their own and others’ — with empathy and respect.

**Theory of Change**  
> **Knowledge** — Students learn that feelings are **mental and bodily signals** that communicate information about experiences. They observe how emotions arise, appear in the body, and shift with context, gaining metacognitive awareness of emotional processes (Posner & Rothbart; Denham et al.).  
> **→ Self-efficacy** — Through guided observation and reflection, students see that feelings can be noticed, named, and understood rather than simply reacted to. These mastery experiences strengthen belief in their ability to regulate emotions and respond thoughtfully (Bandura; Zimmerman & Schunk).  
> **→ Mental resilience** — Recognising that feelings are temporary and diverse helps children normalise emotional change, recover from distress, and empathise with others. Understanding the universality of emotion fosters compassion and social belonging (Dweck; Eisenberg & Fabes).  

Together, these stages move children from emotional reactivity toward **emotionally informed self-management and empathy** — key foundations of psychological literacy.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this unit, students will be able to:

1. **Identify** and name a range of common feelings and describe what messages they send.  
2. **Locate** where feelings appear in their bodies and explain that these signals vary across individuals.  
3. **Recognise** that feelings **change over time** and can shift as situations change.  
4. **Explain** that everyone has feelings, though people express them in different ways.  
5. **Demonstrate empathy** by showing curiosity and respect toward how others feel and express themselves.

## Lesson Sequence
1. **L01 — Different Feelings and What They Tell Us**  
   Introducing feelings as messengers that carry useful information about our experiences.  

2. **L02 — How Feelings Show Up in Our Bodies**  
   Exploring the physical signals of emotion and how these differ among individuals.  

3. **L03 — Feelings Change (And That’s Normal)**  
   Understanding that feelings move and transform over time, like the weather.  

4. **L04 — Everyone Has Feelings (Even When They Look Different)**  
   Discovering that all humans experience emotions, but expression varies across people and cultures — building empathy and respect.

## Digital & Interactive Components (MindMaster)
- **Psychology Experiments** – Interactive observation tasks such as *Feelings Messenger Test*, *Where’s the Feeling?*, and *Feelings Speed Test* that make emotion processes visible.  
- **MindMaster Games** – Clicker-based and sequence-building activities like *Match the Feeling*, *Body Signals Expert*, and *Feelings Weather Forecast* for playful practice.  
- **Quizzes** – Scenario- and image-based checks that reinforce emotion recognition and variability.  
- **Reflections** – Guided questions that help students notice how feelings arise and change within themselves.  
- **Teacher Dashboard** – Displays class trends in emotional vocabulary, empathy responses, and engagement.

## Connection to Curriculum Arc
Unit 6 follows directly from **Unit 5: Imagination and Storytelling**, where students learned to use imagination to express ideas and understand others through stories.  
Now that they can imagine and empathise with others’ minds, they extend that understanding to **real emotional experiences** — recognising, naming, and respecting feelings in themselves and in others.  

This unit marks the shift from **cognitive insight** (Units 1–5) to **social-emotional application**, showing that psychology is not only about how the mind works but also **how minds relate**.  
Students develop:
- **Emotional awareness** — observing and describing feelings accurately.  
- **Self-regulation** — using knowledge of emotional change to manage reactions.  
- **Empathy and inclusion** — valuing diverse emotional expressions.  

Together, these outcomes mark a turning point in Grade 1’s journey — from exploring how the mind learns and creates, to understanding how minds feel and connect.
Unit 6 bridges cognitive and emotional literacy, preparing students for the next sequence of units on emotion regulation, empathy in relationships, and decision-making.
