# Lesson 1: Different Feelings and What They Tell Us

## Lesson Objective
Students will learn to identify and name a range of common feelings (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, excitement, surprise) and understand that each feeling carries a message about ourselves and our situations.  
They will discover that all feelings are natural and that the same situation can create different feelings in different people.

## Warm-Up (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *Feelings Detective*  

Display facial expressions (drawn faces or emoji cards). Ask:  
> “What is this person feeling?”  

Encourage children to name the feeling and explain their clue (e.g., wide smile = happy, frown = sad).  
Then introduce:  
> “Feelings are like messengers — they tell us something important.  
> Our job is to become feelings detectives!”

## Explore + Practice (30 minutes)

### Explore A: Introduction to Feelings as Messengers (10 minutes)
**Materials:** Hard copy – Feelings Word Cards (happy, sad, angry, scared, excited, surprised)

Display one feeling word at a time and ask:
- “What does this feeling tell us?” (the message it carries)  
- “When might you feel this?”  
- “Is it a comfortable or uncomfortable feeling?”

Guide discussion:

| Feeling | What It Tells Us |
|----------|----------------|
| Happy | Something good happened or feels right. |
| Sad | We’ve lost or are missing something that matters. |
| Angry | Something feels unfair or a boundary was crossed. |
| Scared | We might be in danger or need to be careful. |
| Excited | Something interesting or good is about to happen. |
| Surprised | Something unexpected occurred. |

Record answers on a class chart visible throughout the lesson.

### Practice B: Psychology Experiment – “Feelings Messenger Test” (via MindMaster)
**Objective:** Show that each feeling carries a useful message about our experiences.

**Game Flow:**
1. **Setup:** Display scenarios one at a time on screen.  
   Students use clickers to select the feeling that best matches each scenario and what message it might be sending.
2. **Example Scenarios:**  
   - “Your friend brought their favourite toy to share with you.” → Happy / Excited  
   - “Your tower of blocks fell down.” → Sad / Angry / Frustrated  
   - “You hear a loud noise at night.” → Scared / Surprised / Cautious  
   - “Someone took your pencil without asking.” → Angry / Sad / Boundary crossed  
   - “You’re about to go on a trip you’ve been waiting for.” → Excited / Happy / Ready
3. **Play:** Students select their answers via clickers (buttons 1–4).  
4. **Feedback:** After each question, the screen shows the correct feeling and its message (e.g., *“Angry tells us something feels unfair.”*).  
5. **Scoring:** +1 point per correct match.  
6. **Win Condition:** 5/5 correct = “Feelings Detective Complete!”

### Practice C: MindMaster Game – “Match the Feeling” (10 minutes)

**Game Format:** Matching Faces to Feelings (Drag / Select)  

**Game Flow:**
1. **Setup:** Screen shows six feeling faces (happy, sad, angry, scared, excited, surprised).  
   Below appears a scenario or image.  
2. **Play:** Students use clickers to select which feeling matches each scenario.  
3. **Scenarios (6 total):**

## Reflection (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *Class Discussion – What Did We Learn About Feelings?*  

Ask:
- “Name one feeling you learned about today and what message it sends.”  
- “Can two people feel different things in the same situation? Why?”

Emphasise:
> “Feelings are messengers. They tell us something important.  
> All feelings are natural.”

## Home Prep (5 minutes)

**Teacher Guidance:**  
> “Tonight, notice feelings happening around you or in you.  
> Tomorrow we’ll use the MindMaster app to play a feelings game.  
> You’ll see short scenarios and pick which feeling someone might have.  
> Your grown-up can help you!”

At-home MindMaster flow:
- Children view 3 short scenarios.  
- Choose the matching feeling via touch or buttons.  
- Scores sync to school (if supported).

## Connection to Unit Arc
Lesson 1 builds the foundation by teaching that feelings are **information systems with messages**.  
Lesson 2 will extend this idea by showing children **where and how feelings appear in the body**, linking mental messages to physical sensations.
