# Lesson 2: Listening and Sharing Roles

---

## Lesson Objective
Students will understand that strong teams distribute responsibility so everyone contributes, and will demonstrate listening, turn-taking, and role-sharing as the skills that make teamwork possible.

---

## Warm-Up (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *"Follow the Instructions" Game*

Split the class into two groups. Give Group A a set of verbal instructions (e.g., “Stand up, hop twice, sit down, clap once”) delivered quickly while everyone listens. Give Group B the same instructions, but this time students are told to chat, look away, and not listen.

After both attempts, ask:  
> “Which group did the instructions correctly? Why? What was different?”

Highlight:  
> “Group A listened. Group B didn’t. Listening helped Group A understand what to do. That’s a teamwork skill!”

## Explore + Practice (30 minutes)

### Explore A: Roles in a Team (6 minutes)

**Activity:** *Real-World Examples + Discussion (Teacher-Led)*

Show pictures or act out quick scenes of different roles:  
- A sports team (captain leading, players executing, someone encouraging)  
- A construction crew (foreman planning, workers building, someone organizing tools)  
- A classroom (teacher explaining, students listening, one student being a helper)

Ask:  
> “Who has different jobs here? What does each person do? Why do we need all of them?”

Introduce the vocabulary:  
**Leading** (deciding what to do), **Organizing** (making sure things are ready), **Creating** (making or building ideas), **Supporting** (helping others).  
Emphasize:  
> “Every role is important. A team doesn’t work if only one person does everything.”

### Practice A: MindMaster Quiz – “What’s the Role?” (8 minutes)

**Activity:** *Quiz (MindMaster App with Clicker Technology)*

**Quiz Format:** Multiple-Choice with Visual Scenarios  

**Quiz Flow:**
- **Setup:** 6 questions presented one at a time on the TV screen. Each question shows a scenario with clicker options 1–4 representing different roles.
- **Questions:**
  1. “Maria is telling the group what to build. What is her role?”  
     (1. Leading, 2. Organizing, 3. Creating, 4. Supporting)
  2. “James is getting all the blocks ready before the group starts. What is he doing?”  
     (1. Leading, 2. Organizing, 3. Creating, 4. Supporting)
  3. “Sophie has a new idea for the tower. What role is that?”  
     (1. Leading, 2. Organizing, 3. Creating, 4. Supporting)
  4. “Kai is helping his friend who is struggling. What is Kai doing?”  
     (1. Leading, 2. Organizing, 3. Creating, 4. Supporting)
  5. “A team is building. The leader decides the plan, the organizer gets materials, the creator thinks of ideas, and the supporter encourages. Who is NOT needed?”  
     (1. None—all are needed, 2. The leader, 3. The organizer, 4. The supporter)
  6. “Which role do YOU think you could do well?”  
     (1. Leading, 2. Organizing, 3. Creating, 4. Supporting)
- **Scoring:** 1 point per correct answer. Questions 1–5 have correct answers; question 6 celebrates all responses.
- **Win Condition:** Group celebrates when 4+ students answer question 5 correctly (“All are needed”).

**Connection to Lesson:** This quiz reinforces that every role is valuable and necessary.

**Timing in Lesson:** Play after Explore A so students have learned the roles.

### Practice B: Psychology Experiment – “What Happens When We Don’t Listen?” (8 minutes)

**Activity:** *Role-Play Experiment (No Materials Needed)*

**Setup:** Divide class into two groups of 4–5. Each group gets the same task:  
> “Build a block tower together and make it as tall as you can.”

**Steps (5-step experiment):**
1. **Condition A (With Listening):** Group 1 works together. Set a timer for 2 minutes. Everyone listens to ideas, takes turns speaking, and contributes. Encourage:  
   > “Listen to each other. Everyone’s idea matters.”  
2. **Condition B (Without Listening):** Group 2 works together for 2 minutes, BUT you whisper to them beforehand:  
   > “Let’s see what happens if people don’t listen to each other. No one listens to anyone else’s ideas. Everyone just does their own thing.”  
3. **Observation:** After both rounds, compare the towers. Ask:  
   > “Which tower is taller or more stable? Which group seemed happier? What was the difference?”  
4. **Debrief:**  
   > “Group 1 listened to each other. They could coordinate—one person built the base while another added to the top. Group 2 didn’t listen. Everyone did their own thing, and the tower was weaker. Listening helps a team work together.”  
5. **Record:** Draw a simple two-column chart:  
   - “Listening → Strong Tower”  
   - “Not Listening → Weaker Tower”

> **Teacher Note:** This is powerful because students see and feel the difference. Mixed ability is fine—everyone experiences the impact of listening/not listening.

### Practice C: MindMaster Game – “Role Round Robin” (8 minutes)

**Activity:** *Game (MindMaster App with Clicker Technology)*  

**Game Format:** Scenario-Based Role Identification with Drag-and-Match  

**Game Flow:**
- **Setup:** On the TV screen, show a team scenario with 4 children. One child is highlighted with a question mark. Below are 4 role cards: Leader, Organizer, Creator, Supporter. Students click buttons 1–4 to match the highlighted child to the correct role.
- **Play (5 scenarios):**
  1. *Child A* is pointing and saying, “Let’s build it wide first, then tall.” → Correct: 1 (Leader)  
  2. *Child B* is laying out blocks neatly and checking materials. → Correct: 2 (Organizer)  
  3. *Child C* says, “What if we use the red blocks for a pattern?” → Correct: 3 (Creator)  
  4. *Child D* says to a teammate, “You’re doing great! Keep going!” → Correct: 4 (Supporter)  
  5. “Which role is LEAST important in a team?” → Correct: 4 (None—all are needed equally)
- **Scoring:** 1 point per correct answer. Display group total after each scenario.
- **Win Condition:** Celebrate when the class reaches 4+ correct answers, emphasizing:  
  > “You know all the roles—and every single one is necessary!”

**Connection to Lesson:** This game reinforces that every role is valuable and interdependent.  

**Timing in Lesson:** Play after Practice A so students have learned role vocabulary.

## Reflection (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *MindMaster Reflection (MindMaster App with Clicker Technology)*  

**Reflection Prompt (Displayed on Screen):**  
> “Which role did YOU feel good at today?”  

Clicker options:  
- Leading  
- Organizing  
- Creating  
- Supporting  
- Not sure / liked them all  

**Process:**  
1. Students click their answer.  
2. Display results as a bar graph.  
3. Brief discussion:  
   > “Look! We have leaders, organizers, creators, and supporters in this class. We need all of you.”

This affirms that different students have different strengths and that all are valued.

## Home Prep (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *Family Role Hunt (Verbal Instruction + Optional Printable)*  

> “Tonight, notice the roles in your family. Who is leading? Who is organizing? Who is creating ideas? Who is supporting? You can draw a picture or just notice. Tomorrow, tell us one role you saw.”

**Optional checklist to send home:**
- Did I see someone leading? ☐  
- Did I see someone organizing? ☐  
- Did I see someone creating? ☐  
- Did I see someone supporting? ☐

## Connection to Unit Arc
Lesson 1 → Lesson 2: Lesson 1 showed students that teamwork exists and works. Lesson 2 reveals the mechanics—the skills (listening, turn-taking, roles) that make it happen.  
Lesson 2 → Lesson 3: Now that students know what teamwork looks like and what skills make it work, Lesson 3 will address what happens when things go wrong—because they will. Students will learn that problems are normal and that the same listening and role-sharing skills can solve them.
