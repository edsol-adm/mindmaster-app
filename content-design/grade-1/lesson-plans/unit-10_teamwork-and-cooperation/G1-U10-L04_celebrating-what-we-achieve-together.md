# Lesson 4: Celebrating What We Achieve Together

---

## Lesson Objective
Students will understand that celebrating collective achievements strengthens team connection and belonging, and will recognize that appreciation for shared effort—not individual winning—is what makes cooperation meaningful and rewarding.

---

## Warm-Up (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *"Who Built It?" Celebration Moment*

Show a photo or hold up a structure the class built together earlier in the unit (or imagine one). Ask:  
> “Who built this? Was it one person, or everyone?”

Celebrate together:  
> “We all did! This is ours. We worked together, listened to each other, solved problems, and built something amazing. How does that feel?”

Emphasize the feeling: pride, connection, and joy in shared success.

Lead-in:  
> “Today we’re celebrating what teams accomplish together—and how that celebration makes us want to work as a team again.”

## Explore + Practice (30 minutes)

### Explore A: Individual vs. Collective Celebration (6 minutes)

**Activity:** *Video + Discussion (Media)*  

Show: “We Work as a Team” from Sesame Street  
**Link:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKz1jBCdg2M  
**Length:** ~2 minutes  

**Alternative:** “Teamwork Makes the Dream Work” compilations on YouTube (~2 min)  

> **Note:** This video is *indicative only*. In the full MindMaster version, a copyright-free or custom video will be produced to illustrate the same teamwork-celebration concept.

After the video, ask:  
> “Did the characters celebrate by saying ‘I won’ or did they celebrate together? What did that celebration feel like?”

Introduce the distinction:  
> “Individual recognition is when one person gets the prize. Collective celebration is when the whole team is recognized for working together. Both feel good, but collective celebration builds stronger teams because everyone matters.”

### Explore B: How Recognition Changes Feelings (4 minutes)

**Activity:** *Teacher-Led Discussion*

Ask:  
> “If I say ‘Marcus built that tower,’ how does Marcus feel? What about the rest of the team?”  

Then ask:  
> “If I say ‘Our team built that tower together—Sarah had the idea, James got the blocks, Zara built the base, and Marcus added the top—what does that feel like?’”

Guide students to recognize:  
> “When everyone is named, everyone feels important. When we celebrate the teamwork, not just one person, the whole team feels proud and connected.”

### Practice A: Psychology Experiment – “Does Recognition Change Motivation?” (via MindMaster) (8 minutes)

**Activity:** *Interactive Experiment (MindMaster App with Clicker Technology)*  

**Experiment Format:** Before-and-After Scenario with Emotional Response  

**Setup:** Present scenarios that show how different types of recognition affect team motivation.

**Scenario 1 – Individual Recognition:**  
Screen 1:  
> “A team just finished a big project. The teacher says: ‘Great job, Sarah! You were the best!’”  

Clicker questions:  
1. “How does Sarah feel?” (1. Very happy, 2. A little happy, 3. Confused)  
2. “How does the rest of the team feel?” (1. Happy together, 2. Left out, 3. Proud)  

Show result: Sarah is very happy, but the team feels left out. Some kids don’t want to work on the next project.

**Scenario 2 – Collective Recognition:**  
Screen 2:  
> “The same team finishes a project. The teacher says: ‘What an amazing team! Sarah had the idea, James organized the materials, Zara built carefully, and Marcus encouraged everyone. You worked together and made something wonderful.’”  

Clicker question:  
> “How does the team feel now?” (1. All happy and proud, 2. Confused, 3. Sad)  

Show result: The whole team lights up. Everyone feels important. They can’t wait to work together again.

**Scoring:** Not scored for right/wrong, but for observation.  
The experiment demonstrates cause and effect: **Collective recognition → stronger team motivation.**

**Connection to Lesson:**  
Students see that how we celebrate changes how team members feel and whether they want to cooperate again.

### Practice B: MindMaster Game – “Who Deserves Recognition?” (9 minutes)

**Activity:** *Game (MindMaster App with Clicker Technology)*  

**Game Format:** Scenario-Based Recognition Sorting with Consequence Display  

**Game Flow:**
- **Setup:** Present scenarios where different types of recognition happen. Students click to identify which type of recognition is collective (strengthens the team) vs. individual (might weaken team connection).

**Scenario 1 – The Tower:**  
> “Our class just finished a block tower project. The teacher says: ‘Great job, Marcus! You built it perfectly!’ What happens to the team?”  
Options:  
- Collective celebration—everyone feels proud together  
- Individual recognition—Marcus is happy, but other kids feel left out  
- The team celebrates equally with Marcus  
Consequence: Show bar graph: Some kids feel included, some don’t.  
**Correct answer:** 2

**Scenario 2 – The Group Effort:**  
> “The class just finished a poster. The teacher says: ‘Sarah had the idea, James organized materials, Zara created the design, Marcus encouraged everyone. Our whole team made this amazing poster together!’ What happens?”  
Options:  
- Individual recognition—only Sarah feels good  
- Collective celebration—everyone feels proud and important  
- Nobody feels recognized  
Consequence: Show kids all smiling. “Everyone was named. Everyone feels like they matter.”  
**Correct answer:** 2

**Scenario 3 – Next Time:**  
> “Which type of recognition makes kids WANT to work as a team again?”  
Options:  
- Individual recognition (one person gets praised)  
- Collective celebration (the team is recognized together)  
- No recognition at all  
**Correct answer:** 2

**Scenario 4 – What to Celebrate:**  
> “When we celebrate a team’s work, what should we focus on?”  
Options:  
- Who won or was the best  
- The teamwork, effort, and how everyone contributed  
- Only the leader’s ideas  
**Correct answer:** 2

**Scoring:** 1 point per correct answer. Group total displayed.  
**Win Condition:** Celebrate when the class reaches 3+ correct answers. Announce:  
> “You understand that celebrating together is what makes teams strong!”

**Connection to Lesson:**  
This game demonstrates that collective recognition builds team belonging and motivation better than individual praise.

**Timing in Lesson:** Play after Explore A & B so students have learned the distinction between individual and collective celebration.

## Connection to Unit Arc
Lesson 3 → Lesson 4 (Capstone): Lesson 3 showed students that solving problems together builds trust and resilience. Lesson 4 now shows that celebrating those achievements—recognizing the shared effort, not just individual success—completes the cycle.  

**End of Unit Reflection:** By the end of Lesson 4, students have moved from “What is teamwork?” (Lesson 1) through “How do we do it?” (Lessons 2–3) to “Why does it matter?” (Lesson 4). They finish with confidence in both their individual capabilities and their value as contributing team members—ready to apply teamwork to families, classrooms, and communities beyond this unit.
