# Lesson 3: Solving Problems Together

## Lesson Objective
Students will understand that disagreements and conflicts are normal parts of relationships and will learn and practice simple problem-solving strategies (listening, compromising, taking turns, asking for help) to work through conflicts respectfully.

---

## Warm-Up (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *“Conflict Detective” – Spot the Problem*  

Show or act out a quick scenario:

**Scenario:** Two children both want to play with the same toy. One child grabs it. The other child cries. They’re both upset.

Ask:
> “What’s the problem here? How do you think they feel?”

Take 2–3 answers. Then ask:
> “Do you think they’re not friends anymore because they disagreed? Or can friends disagree and still be friends?”

Guide toward:
> “Friends can disagree. That’s normal. What matters is how they solve the problem together.”

**Transition:**  
> “Today, we’re going to learn how to be problem-solvers—just like scientists solve problems in experiments. When friends or family members disagree, you can use special strategies to solve it together and keep the relationship strong.”

## Explore + Practice (30 minutes)

### Explore A: Video – Solving Problems Together (3 minutes)

**Media:** YouTube Video  
**Title:** *“Sesame Street: Elmo and Abby Solve a Problem”*  
**Link:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEZWJPfO0dU  
**Duration:** ~2 minutes  

> **Note:** This video is *indicative only*. In the full MindMaster version, a copyright-free or modified video will be featured to illustrate the same concept of listening and compromise in problem-solving.

**Teacher Setup:**  
“Watch how Elmo and Abby disagree about something, but they work together to solve it.  
Notice: Do they listen to each other? Do they try to find a solution that works for both of them?”

After the video, ask:
- “What was the problem?”  
- “How did they solve it? Did they listen? Did they compromise?”

### Explore B: Guided Discussion + Concept Introduction (7 minutes)

**Classroom Resource:** Teacher-Led Discussion + Visual Aid  

Introduce the idea that conflicts are normal and learnable:

> “Here’s something important: Disagreements happen. Friends disagree. Families disagree. That’s normal. It doesn’t mean the friendship is broken or that someone is ‘bad.’ It just means you have different wants or ideas.  
>  
> When disagreements happen, we can use special strategies to solve them. Let’s learn them:”

Display and explain each strategy:

1. **Listen to Each Person**  
   “First, listen. If your friend wants something and you want something else, you both say what you want. You listen without interrupting.”

2. **Take Turns**  
   “Sometimes the solution is: I go first now, you go first next time. That’s fair.”

3. **Compromise**  
   “Sometimes you find a middle solution. Like, you both want the red block. Solution: Build with it together for 5 minutes, then take turns.”

4. **Ask for Help**  
   “If you can’t solve it together, ask a grown-up: ‘We have a problem. Can you help us?’”

5. **Stay Respectful**  
   “Even when you disagree, you’re still kind. You don’t call names or be mean.”

Ask:
> “Has anyone ever solved a problem with a friend or family member? What did you do?”

Take 2–3 examples and affirm, naming the strategy used.

**Key point:**  
> “Problem-solving is a skill. The more you practise, the better you get. And when you solve problems together, your friendship or family relationship gets stronger, not weaker.”

### Practice A: Psychology Experiment – “Problem-Solving Steps” (In-Class Demonstration with Role-Play, ≤5 steps) (8 minutes)

**Classroom Resource:** Role-Play + Hard Copy Scenario Cards  

This is a guided, step-by-step *experiment* where children see a conflict, apply problem-solving steps, and observe the outcome.

**Setup & Steps:**
1. **Present a conflict scenario:** “Two friends want the same swing. Both say ‘I want to go first!’ Now what?”
2. **Step 1 – Listen:** “Let’s listen to each person. Friend 1 says, ‘I want to go first because I’ve been waiting.’ Friend 2 says, ‘I want to go first because no one let me go first yesterday.’”
3. **Step 2 – Try a solution:** “Can we take turns? Friend 1 goes first for 5 minutes, then Friend 2 goes. Is that fair?” (Ask: “Do both friends get something they want?”)
4. **Step 3 – Check if it works:** “Both friends got a turn. The problem is solved. They’re both happy. The friendship is still strong.”
5. **Reflection:** “What strategy did we use? We listened and we compromised. And now the friends can play together again.”

Repeat with 1–2 more scenarios (e.g., two children want to play different games; one child took another’s toy without asking).

**Why this works:**  
Students see the step-by-step process and understand that conflicts can be solved through observable, learnable strategies.

### Practice B: MindMaster Game – “Problem-Solver Challenge” (10 minutes)

**MindMaster:** In-Class Game (with clicker technology)  
**Game Format:** Scenario Choices (children select the best problem-solving strategy)

**Game Flow:**
- **Setup:**  
  On-screen: conflict scenario (text or image).  
  Below: 3–4 possible solutions (buttons 1–4).  
  Teacher explains:  
  > “You’ll see friends or family members with a problem. Which solution is the best? Tap the number.”

- **Play (examples):**  
  **Scenario:** “Maya and Kai both want the red crayon.”  
  Options:  
  1) Maya grabs it and won’t share.  
  2) Kai throws the crayon away.  
  3) They take turns using it.  
  4) They ask the teacher for help.  
  *Best:* 3 (4 also acceptable).  
  On-screen feedback: “Yes! Taking turns means both friends get to use the crayon. The friendship stays strong!”

  Additional scenarios (8–10 total):  
  - “Two kids want to play different games.” → Play one, then the other (take turns/compromise).  
  - “Your friend knocked over your block tower by accident.” → Build it together (cooperation/asking for help).  
  - “You wanted to sit next to your friend at lunch, but someone else did.” → Sit together tomorrow (listening/compromising).  
  - “Your sibling took your toy without asking.” → Talk about feelings; ask them to ask next time (listening/respect).  
  - “Friends disagree about the rules of a game.” → Listen to both ideas; choose one or make new rules (compromise/listening).  
  - “Your friend said something that hurt your feelings.” → Tell them how you feel; listen to their side (respectful communication).  
  - “You and a friend want different snacks.” → Each get your favourite snack (respect/acceptance).  
  - “Two kids got mad and won’t talk.” → Ask a grown-up to help; take a break and try again later (asking for help).

- **Scoring:** +1 point per best solution.  
- **Win Condition:** 7+ out of 8 = “Conflict Champion!”  Class average ≥ 6 = “Problem-Solvers” badge.

*Teacher Note:* Helps children see that problem-solving follows patterns and that they can learn to recognise good solutions.

### Practice C: Role-Play Practice – “Try It Out” (5 minutes)

**Classroom Resource:** In-Class Role-Play with Guidance  

**Activity:**
1. Pair up students (or use volunteers).  
2. Give each pair a simple conflict scenario (e.g., “You both want to be line leader tomorrow. What do you do?”).  
3. Ask them to role-play solving it using one of the strategies (listening, taking turns, compromising, asking for help).  
4. Invite 2–3 pairs to act it out for the class (30 seconds each).  
5. After each, ask: “What strategy did they use? Did they keep the friendship strong?”

*Teacher Prompt:* “Remember, there are different ways to solve a problem. The important thing is that both people feel heard and respected.”

## Reflection (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *MindMaster Reflection – “How Do You Handle Disagreements?”*  

**Game Flow:**
- **Setup:**  
  On-screen reflection questions; students respond via clickers (buttons 1–3 or 1–4).  
  On-screen tally shows class responses.

**Reflection Prompts (4):**
1. “Is it okay for friends to disagree?”  
   1 = Yes, 2 = No, 3 = Sometimes  
   *Teacher response:* “Yes! Disagreements are normal. What matters is how we solve them.”  
2. “When you have a disagreement with a friend, what should you do FIRST?”  
   1 = Tell the teacher, 2 = Listen to your friend’s side, 3 = Walk away  
   *Teacher response:* “Yes! Listening first helps you understand the problem.”  
3. “Does solving a problem together make friendships stronger or weaker?”  
   1 = Stronger, 2 = Weaker  
   *Teacher response:* “Exactly! When you work through problems, you trust each other more.”  
4. “Which strategy would you use if you both wanted the same toy?”  
   1 = Take turns, 2 = Play together, 3 = Either/both are good ideas  
   *Teacher response:* “Great thinking! There are often different good solutions.”

*No individual scoring; class discussion of responses.*

**Teacher Closing:**  
> “You’re all problem-solvers. Every time you listen and find a solution that works for everyone, you’re strengthening your relationships. That’s powerful.”

## Home Prep (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *Prepare for MindMaster Reflection at Home*  

**Teacher Explanation:**  
> “Tonight, you’ll do a reflection activity on MindMaster at home. You’ll think about conflicts—how they happen and how you solve them—and you’ll answer questions using your clicker.  
> Before you go, let’s practise. I’m going to ask you a question about solving problems, and you’ll tap YES or NO on your clicker.”

**In-Class Practice Question:**  
> “If a friend and you disagree, is it okay to listen to what they want? YES or NO?”

Have students respond. Celebrate.

**Homework Letter:**  
> **Dear Grown-up,**  
> Your child learned today that disagreements are normal in friendships and families—and that problem-solving is a skill that makes relationships stronger.  
> Tonight, they’ll do a short MindMaster reflection (5 minutes) thinking about how to handle conflicts. This is great practice for the science of relationships!

*Teacher Note:* Emphasise that students are “relationship scientists”—they’re learning that conflicts aren’t failures; they’re opportunities to practise a skill.

## Connection to Unit Arc
**Building on:** Lessons 1 and 2 taught that families and friendships are systems with roles and qualities. Lesson 3 teaches that these systems sometimes experience friction (disagreements), and that friction isn’t a sign of failure—it's normal and can be handled skilfully.  
**Prepares for:** Lesson 4 will celebrate the diversity of family and friendship structures, showing that what makes all relationships strong—whether they look different on the outside—is their capacity to work through challenges, communicate, and care for one another.
