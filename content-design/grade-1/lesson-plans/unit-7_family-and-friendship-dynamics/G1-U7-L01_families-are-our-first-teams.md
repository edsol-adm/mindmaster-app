# Lesson 1: Families Are Our First Teams

## Lesson Objective
Students will understand that families function as teams in which members have different roles and responsibilities, and that families support one another to help the group function well—regardless of what the family looks like.

---

## Warm-Up (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *“Team Huddle” Role Spot*  

Gather students in a circle. Ask:  
> “Who knows what a team is? What do teams do?”

Take 2–3 answers (e.g., “They play together,” “Everyone has a job”).  
Then ask:  
> “What if I told you that your family is also a team? Let's see if we can spot the different 'jobs' people do at home.”

Show a simple picture or ask students to mime different family member jobs (e.g., one person cooking, another setting the table, another feeding a pet).  
Ask students to guess each job as it’s acted out.

**Transition:**  
> “Today, we're going to discover how families work like teams, and why that matters to how you grow up.”

## Explore + Practice (30 minutes)

### Explore A: Video – Understanding Family as a System (5 minutes)

**Media:** YouTube Video  
**Title:** *“The Importance of Family” – Sesame Street*  
**Link:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5z2SIqVAEE  
**Duration:** ~2 minutes  

> **Note:** This video is *indicative only*. In the full MindMaster version, a copyright-free or modified video will be featured to illustrate the same concept of families as teams.

**Teacher Setup:**  
Show this short video to students. As they watch, ask them to notice:  
> “What are the different family members doing? How are they helping each other?”

After the video, ask:
- “What did you see families doing together?”  
- “Did every family look the same? Why does that matter?”

### Explore B: Guided Discussion + Concept Introduction (5 minutes)

**Classroom Resource:** Teacher-Led Discussion  

Introduce the idea of *roles* and *responsibilities* in simple language:

> “In a team—like a soccer team—each person has a job. One person is the goalkeeper, one kicks the ball, one passes. Everyone’s job is different, but they all work together to win.  
>  
> Your family is the same. Your mom or dad might cook meals. Your brother or sister might help with dishes. You might feed a pet or set the table. Everyone has a different job, but you're all working together to keep the family happy and healthy.”

Show a simple visual: draw or display a circle with family roles written in it (e.g., “Parent cooks,” “Child feeds pet,” “Sibling sets table”).  

Ask:
- “What jobs do people in your family do?”

Take 3–4 answers. Affirm each one.

### Practice A: Psychology Experiment – “Family Roles Detective” (In-Class Observation, ≤5 steps) (8 minutes)

**Classroom Resource:** Hard Copy + Role Play  

This is a fun, active *observation experiment* where children identify roles within family scenarios.

**Setup & Steps:**
1. Show or describe a scene: “It’s dinner time. Mom is cooking pasta. Dad is setting the table. Your sister is drawing a picture to put on the fridge.”
2. Ask students to spot roles: “Who is doing what? What is each person’s job right now?”
3. Record their observations on the whiteboard (e.g., “Mom = cooking, Dad = setting table, Sister = decorating”).
4. Repeat with 2–3 scenarios from different family contexts (e.g., morning routine, homework time, playtime).
5. Reflection question: “Did everyone have the same job? Did they all help the family in different ways?”

**Why this works:**  
Children practice observing and naming roles, understanding that different responsibilities = teamwork.

### Practice B: MindMaster Game – “Family Team Puzzle” (12 minutes)

**MindMaster:** In-Class Game (with clicker technology)  
**Game Format:** Sorting / Categorizing (drag items into correct categories on screen)

**Game Flow:**
- **Setup:**  
  Display screen shows family members on the left (Mom, Dad, Child, Sibling) and tasks/roles on the right (cooking, cleaning, homework help, playing games).  
  Each student has a clicker.  
  Teacher explains:  
  > “You’ll see a family member and a family job. If they match, tap YES on your clicker. If they don’t match in your family, tap NO.”
- **Play:**  
  8–10 matching pairs appear on screen (e.g., “Dad cooks dinner”).  
  Students respond YES or NO using clickers.  
  After each response, give brief feedback (e.g., “Nice thinking! Dads can cook. What else do they do?”).
- **Scoring:** +1 per correct response. Visual feedback (sound or icon) for correct answers.
- **Win Condition:**  
  Individual scores tallied; top 3 scorers recognized.  
  Or team points if playing as a class.

*Teacher Note:* This game helps children see that roles are flexible—different family members might do different things—and that families work as systems.

## Reflection (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *Circle Discussion – “What Did We Discover?”*  

Gather students in a circle. Ask:
- “What is a family team?”  
- “What different jobs do people in families have?”  
- “Can your family look different from your friend’s family and still be a team?”

Take 2–3 responses per question.  
Affirm that families come in different shapes and sizes, but what makes them teams is how they help each other.

**Closing statement:**  
> “You’re part of a team right now. Your family team depends on each person doing their part—and that’s how families stay strong.”

## Home Prep (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *Prepare for MindMaster at Home*  

**Teacher Explanation:**  
> “Tonight, you're going to do an activity on MindMaster with a grown-up at home. You'll see pictures of families and family jobs, and you'll use your clicker to answer questions about what different family members do.  
> Before you go home, let's practice using your clicker. I'm going to ask you a YES/NO question about families, and you'll tap the YES or NO button on your clicker. Let's try it.”

**Practice Question:**  
> “Do families have different jobs to do? YES or NO?”

Have students respond and praise quick, confident clicking.

**Homework Letter:**
> **Dear Grown-up,**  
> Tonight, your child will complete a short MindMaster quiz about family teamwork.  
> They'll see families doing different jobs and tap YES or NO to answer questions.  
> It takes about 5 minutes. Enjoy it together!

*Teacher Note:* Emphasize that using the clicker at home is the same as in class—they’re doing science by answering questions!

## Connection to Unit Arc
**Building on:** Introduces the foundational concept of family as a social system with roles and cooperation—preparing students to understand that all social groups (friendships, teams, classrooms) work similarly.  
**Prepares for:** Lesson 2 explores friendships as another kind of team system, where members also have roles (the one who listens, the one who makes everyone laugh, the one who shares) and responsibilities (being kind, keeping promises, taking turns).
