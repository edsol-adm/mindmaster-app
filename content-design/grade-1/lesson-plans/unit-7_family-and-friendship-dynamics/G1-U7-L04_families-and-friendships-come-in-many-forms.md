# Lesson 4: Families and Friendships Come in Many Forms

## Lesson Objective
Students will recognize and celebrate the diversity of family structures and friendship patterns, understanding that what makes relationships strong—whether families or friendships—is the quality of care, respect, and support within them, not their external form.

---

## Warm-Up (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *“Spot the Team” – Family and Friendship Diversity*  

Show or describe 3–4 different family or friendship images or scenarios:  
- A family with two moms raising a child together.  
- A child living with grandparents.  
- A child with many friends vs. one close friend.  
- A blended family (step-siblings, step-parents).  
- Friends who live far apart but stay close.

Ask:  
> “Do these families and friendships all look the same? Are they all teams? How do you know?”

Guide toward:  
> “They look different on the outside, but what makes them teams is that people care for and support each other.”

**Transition:**  
> “Today, we’re learning that families and friendships come in lots of different shapes and sizes—and that’s wonderful. What matters is the caring inside, not what it looks like from the outside.”

## Explore + Practice (30 minutes)

### Explore A: Guided Discussion + Concept Introduction (5 minutes)

**Classroom Resource:** Teacher-Led Discussion + Visual Aids  

> “Families and friendships can look very different. Let’s think about some examples.”

**Families can look different:**
- Some have a mom and a dad.  
- Some have two moms or two dads.  
- Some have just one parent.  
- Some kids live with grandparents, aunts, uncles, or other family members.  
- Some families are large; others small.  
- Some move around a lot; others stay in one place.  
- Different cultures have different family traditions.

**Friendships can look different too:**
- Some friends live nearby; others far away.  
- Some have many friends; others have one or two close ones.  
- Some friendships grow at school, others in activities like sports or art.  
- Friends can be any age, background, or religion.

**Key message:**  
> “In all families and friendships, people care, help, and respect each other. That’s what makes them strong.”

Ask:
> “Can you think of a family or friendship that looks different from yours? What makes it special?”

Affirm each response:
> “Yes! That’s a family or friendship too. What matters is the care inside.”

*Teacher Note:* Emphasize inclusion, empathy, and respect—this is an observational learning activity, not personal disclosure.
