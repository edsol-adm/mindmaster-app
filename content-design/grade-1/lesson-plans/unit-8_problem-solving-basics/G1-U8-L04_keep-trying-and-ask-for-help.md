# Lesson 4: Keep Trying and Ask for Help

## Lesson Objective
Students will learn that **persistence and help-seeking** are part of problem-solving, not signs of failure.  
They will discover that sometimes the first solution doesn’t work — and that’s normal.  
They will practise trying again with a new idea and recognise when to ask for help from others.  
By the end, students will understand that perseverance and collaboration strengthen confidence and resilience.

## Warm-Up (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *When Things Don’t Work the First Time*  

Show or tell two short examples:

1️⃣ A scientist mixing ingredients for an experiment that doesn’t bubble yet.  
2️⃣ A child trying to tie shoelaces, failing once, then succeeding.  

Ask:  
> “Did they stop when it didn’t work?”  
> “What did they do next?”

Guide toward:  
> “They kept trying — and sometimes asked for help. That’s what problem-solvers do.”

**Psychology Frame:**  
> “When scientists test an idea and it doesn’t work, they don’t give up.  
> They try again, change something, or ask a teammate for help.  
> That’s what we’re learning to do today.”

## Explore + Practice (30 minutes)

### Explore A: Video – Keep Trying and Asking for Help (3 min)

**Media:** YouTube Video  
**Title:** *“Keep Trying – A Song About Persistence and Learning from Mistakes”*  
**Link:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaU5D4uMh3E  
**Duration:** ~2 minutes  

> **Note:** This video is *indicative only*. In the full MindMaster version, a modified or copyright-free video will be featured to illustrate the same concept of persistence and help-seeking.

**Teacher Setup:**  
Play the video, then ask:  
- “What was the character trying to do?”  
- “Did it work the first time?”  
- “What helped them succeed?”  

**Key Point:**  
> “When one idea doesn’t work, it doesn’t mean we failed — it means our brain is still working on the puzzle!”

### Explore B: Story Discussion – Real-Life Problem Solvers (5 min)

**Story Options:**  
Read aloud a short story from classroom library or teacher-made example, such as:  
- *“The Bridge That Broke”* — children try three ways before building a bridge that works.  
- *“The Missing Button”* — child keeps looking for solutions, then asks an adult for help sewing.  

**Discussion Prompts:**  
- “What did the characters do when their first idea didn’t work?”  
- “Who helped them?”  
- “What happened after they asked for help?”  
- “Did asking for help mean they gave up?”  

Summarise:  
> “No — asking for help is part of solving the problem. It’s teamwork.”  

**Science Frame:**  
> “In experiments, scientists often work together. When they ask others for ideas, they get stronger results — just like we do.”

### Practice A: Psychology Experiment – “Try Again, Scientist!” (10 min)

**Type:** In-Class Observation Experiment  
**Objective:** Students experience what it feels like to try multiple times and ask for help.

**Materials:** Simple puzzle or task (e.g., building a paper bridge that can hold a coin).  

**Activity Flow:**  
1️⃣ **Setup (1 min):** Provide each pair with 2 strips of paper, tape, and one coin.  
 Challenge: “Build a bridge from one book to another that can hold the coin.”  
2️⃣ **Attempt 1 (2 min):** Let students build freely and test their bridge. Some will collapse.  
3️⃣ **Discussion (2 min):** Ask: “What happened? Did it hold the coin? Why?”  
 List their ideas briefly on the board.  
4️⃣ **Attempt 2 (3 min):** “Try again — change one thing.” Students rebuild and test.  
5️⃣ **Reflection (2 min):** Ask: “Who needed help? Who kept trying?” Celebrate all groups.  

**Teacher Wrap-Up:**  
> “That’s what scientists do: test, change, and try again. You didn’t fail — you experimented.”  

**Key Concept:** Failure = feedback; persistence = progress.

### Practice B: MindMaster Game – “Keep Trying Challenge” (8 min)

**Format:** Clicker-based Decision Game  

**Game Flow:**  
1️⃣ Show a problem on screen (e.g., “Your block tower falls down.”).  
2️⃣ Students choose:  
 A) Give up. B) Try again a new way. ✅ C) Get upset and stop.  
3️⃣ After revealing answers, discuss: “Why is B better?”  
4️⃣ Next scenario: “You can’t solve a puzzle on the first try.”  
 A) Ask for help ✅ B) Throw it away C) Yell  
5️⃣ Continue with 6–8 scenarios.  
6️⃣ +1 point per growth-minded or help-seeking choice.  
7️⃣ Win Condition: “Keep Trying Champion!”  

**Teacher Note:**  
After each scenario, reinforce:  
> “It’s okay to feel frustrated. The important thing is to try again or ask for help.”

---

### Practice C: Role-Play – Asking for Help (5 min)

**Materials:** None required.  

**Activity Flow:**  
1️⃣ Model a short role-play with a student: Teacher pretends to struggle opening a jar and asks, “Can someone help me?” Student helps and they succeed.  
2️⃣ Ask: “What happened when I asked for help?” “Did I look weak or smart?”  
3️⃣ Pairs act their own short scenes (e.g., “Can’t reach book,” “Need help fixing toy”).  
4️⃣ Debrief: “Helping and being helped are both strengths. It means you’re a team.”  

**Science Frame:**  
> “Even scientists ask each other for advice when an experiment doesn’t work. That’s called collaboration.”

## Reflection (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *What Did We Learn from Trying Again?*  

Gather students in a circle and ask:  
- “Who had a bridge that didn’t work the first time?”  
- “What helped the second time?”  
- “How did it feel to ask for help or to give help?”  
- “Does asking for help mean you failed?”  

**Teacher Closing:**  
> “Every time something doesn’t work and you keep trying, your brain grows stronger.  
> That’s science — learning from experience.”

---

## Home Prep (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *Notice Help and Effort at Home*  

**Teacher Instructions:**  
> “Tonight, look around at home and notice when someone asks for help or keeps trying after something doesn’t work — it might be your parents, your siblings, or even you!  
> Tomorrow, share one example with us.”  

**Optional MindMaster Reflection:**  
If digital access is available, assign: *‘Try Again! Quiz’* (a short clicker reflection on persistence and help-seeking).

## Connection to Unit Arc
Lesson 3 taught that flexible thinkers find many solutions.  
Lesson 4 completes the cycle by teaching what to do when none of those solutions work — keep trying and seek help.  
This develops **self-efficacy** (“I can keep going”) and **mental resilience** (“I can learn from challenges”).  
It prepares students for Unit 9, which moves from problem-solving to **decision-making** and **reasoned choice** — the next stage of psychology literacy.
