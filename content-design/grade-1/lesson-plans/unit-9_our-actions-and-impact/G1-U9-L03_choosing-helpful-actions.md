# Lesson 3: Choosing Helpful Actions

## Lesson Objective
Students will distinguish between **helpful and unhelpful actions** by analysing their effects.  
They will learn to **predict consequences before acting** and **apply intentional action selection** to choose behaviours that lead to positive results for themselves, others, and their environment.

---

## Warm-Up (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *Consequence Prediction Game*

Show simple action images one at a time (no context). Ask students to predict:  
> “What will happen after this action? Is it helpful or unhelpful?”

Examples:
- Child sharing a snack with a friend → Friend is happy (helpful)  
- Child grabbing a toy from another child → Conflict (unhelpful)  
- Child holding a door for someone → Person feels appreciated (helpful)

After each prediction, reveal the consequence:
> “Yes, that’s what happens. This action is helpful/unhelpful because it creates a positive or negative effect.”

**Teacher Note:** This primes students to think in terms of choosing actions based on outcomes, not just reacting.

## Explore + Practice (30 minutes)

### Explore A: Psychology Video – Decision-Making & Consequences (3 min)

**Media:** YouTube video  
**Title:** *“Making Good Choices”* (Crash Course Kids) or *“The Power of Choices”* (SciShow Kids)  
**Link:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8hL6uNvRCo *(or similar)*  
**Length:** ~3 minutes

> **Note:** This video is *indicative only*. In the full MindMaster version, a copyright-free or modified video will be featured to illustrate the concept of choosing actions intentionally to shape outcomes.

**Teacher Facilitation:**  
1. Play the video. Pause to highlight moments where a character makes a choice and experiences a consequence.  
2. After the video: “What choice did the character make? What happened after?”  
3. Connect to the lesson: “When you choose an action, you’re also choosing the effect that follows.”

### Explore B: In-Class Psychology Experiment – Decision Tree (7 min)

**Type:** Psychology Experiment — *Action Selection Test*  
**Materials:** Hard copy or large chart paper, classroom space

**Setup:** Create a large physical or visual “decision tree” with a situation at the top and two branches (helpful choice / unhelpful choice) leading to different outcomes.

**Example Scenario:**  
- Situation: “A friend accidentally knocked over your tower of blocks. What do you do?”  
  - **Branch A (Helpful):** Say, “That’s okay, let’s build it again together.” → Friend feels better, friendship stays strong.  
  - **Branch B (Unhelpful):** Say, “You’re so clumsy! I’m mad!” → Friend is sad, you’re both upset.

**Steps:**  
1. Present the scenario.  
2. Ask students to move to the branch they would choose.  
3. Have groups describe what might happen next.  
4. Reflect together: “Both were choices. But one choice led to a helpful effect, and one didn’t. When you understand that, you can choose the action that creates the effect you want.”

**Teacher Note:** This is embodied learning — moving physically between branches helps younger learners internalise consequence prediction.

### Practice A: Guided Role-Play – Thinking Sequence in Action (8 min)

**Activity:** *“What do I want to happen?” → “Which action will help that happen?” → “I choose that one.”*

**Materials:** Scenario cards, classroom props (optional)

**Model Scenario:**  
- Situation: Two children want to use the only red marker.  
- Step 1: “What do I want to happen?” → Use the marker, keep peace.  
- Step 2: Brainstorm options (grab, ask to share, use a different colour).  
- Step 3: Choose the action that creates the helpful effect.

**Additional Scenarios:**  
- Wanting to join a game (include vs. demand)  
- Noticing someone is alone at lunch (invite vs. ignore)

**Teacher Facilitation:**  
Guide students through all three steps explicitly.  
After each: “You used your thinking brain to choose an action that created a helpful effect. That’s what we do when we make good choices.”

### Practice B: Guided Discovery – Patterns in Helpful vs. Unhelpful Actions (7 min)

**Materials:** Comparison chart (two columns), markers

**Chart Setup:**

| Helpful Actions (Positive Effects)          | Unhelpful Actions (Create Problems)      |
|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Sharing → friends want to play              | Grabbing → people are upset             |
| Including others → they feel part of group | Excluding → people are hurt             |
| Helping → people trust me                   | Breaking things → extra work, conflict  |
| Listening → people like talking to me      | Interrupting → people get annoyed       |
| Cleaning up → things stay organised        | Leaving mess → chaos                    |

**Teacher Facilitation:**  
- Build this chart with students.  
- Ask: “What helpful actions have you seen? What happened after?”  
- Highlight: “Certain actions consistently create helpful effects. Others consistently create problems. When you know this, you can choose the action that works.”

### Practice C: MindMaster In-Class Game – Cause & Effect Scenario Matcher (5 min)

**Format:** Multiple-choice or drag-to-match  
**Materials:** MindMaster app, clickers

**Game Flow:**  
- Display a scenario (e.g., “A friend is sitting alone at lunch”).  
- Show four character cards with different actions.  
- Students match each action to its likely outcome or vote for the most helpful action.  
- Score: 1 point per correct match; +1 bonus for fast answers.

**How This Connects:** This game builds fluency in predicting consequences and choosing helpful actions intentionally.

## Reflection (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *Choice Reflection Game*

**Format:** Confidence-based reflection using clickers.  
**Scenarios:**  
- “You want to join a game at recess. Which action will help you play?”  
- “A friend knocked over your work. Which action would you choose?”  
- “You want others to include you in the future. Which action helps?”

For each scenario, students:  
1. Choose the action.  
2. Rate their confidence (Not sure / Pretty sure / Very sure).  
3. Discuss aloud why they chose it.

**Teacher Debrief:**  
> “Who felt confident about their choices? Why?”  
Highlight that understanding cause-and-effect makes them more confident decision-makers.

## Home Prep (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *MindMaster Family Scenario Predictor*

**Instructions for families:**  
- Log into MindMaster at home.  
- Play *“The Helpful Choice Game”* where children see scenarios and pick helpful actions.  
- Talk afterward: “Which action worked best? Why? What effect did it create?”  
- Bring their score or a story about a helpful choice to school.

**Teacher Note:** This reinforces intentional action selection and brings family conversations into the learning process.

## Connection to Unit Arc

Lesson 3 advances Lesson 2: Students move from understanding that small actions accumulate to **choosing actions intentionally** to create helpful effects.  
Lesson 4 completes the cycle by teaching that when actions produce unhelpful effects, **mistakes become learning opportunities** to try again.
