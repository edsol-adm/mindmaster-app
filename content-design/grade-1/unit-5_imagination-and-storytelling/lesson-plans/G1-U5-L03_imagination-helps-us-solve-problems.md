# Lesson 3: Imagination Helps Us Solve Problems

## Lesson Objective
Students will understand that imagination is a practical problem-solving tool—the mind's ability to picture possibilities, test ideas mentally, and generate more than one solution to a challenge. They will practise “seeing ahead” to build confidence and resilience when facing tricky situations.

---

## Warm-Up (5 minutes)

**Activity:** “Stuck? What Else Could You Try?”

Present a simple, real problem:  
> “Imagine you want to build a tall tower with blocks, but it keeps falling over. What could you try?”

Invite students to shout out ideas (no judgment):  
- Make the base wider  
- Use heavier blocks at the bottom  
- Tape the blocks together  
- Build outside where there’s no wind  
- Make it shorter instead  

Ask: “How did you come up with all these ideas? You imagined what might happen if you tried each one. That’s imagination as a problem-solving tool.”

**Key teaching point:** When something is tricky, imagination helps you say, “What else could I try?” Your brain can picture possibilities before you act.

## Explore + Practice (30 minutes)

### Explore A: Imagination as a Problem-Solving Tool (6 minutes)

**Materials:** Hard copy – visual showing a simple problem with multiple solution arrows.  

Example:  
Problem (centre): “A friend wants to play tag, but you don’t feel like running.”  
Solutions:  
1️⃣ Imagine suggesting a quieter game.  
2️⃣ Imagine walking instead of running.  
3️⃣ Imagine playing later when you feel ready.

Explain:  
> “When you face a tricky situation, imagination lets you see different possibilities before you act. You can mentally test ideas and pick the one that feels right.”

**Model:**  
Recognise problem → Imagine possible solutions → Choose the best one.  
**Key teaching point:** Imagination lets your brain test ideas safely inside your mind before trying them. That builds confidence and resilience.

### Explore B: Imagination + Thinking + Feelings in Problem-Solving (6 minutes)

**Materials:** Hard copy – diagram of three connected circles: “IMAGINATION,” “THINKING,” “FEELINGS.”

Explain:  
> “When you solve a problem using imagination, three parts of your mind work together:
> - **Imagination** pictures possibilities (what could happen).  
> - **Thinking** organises those possibilities into a plan.  
> - **Feelings** guide what matters—what feels right or fair.”

**Model example:**  
> “If your tower keeps falling, imagination says, ‘I could make the base wider or use heavier blocks.’  
> Thinking says, ‘The wider base seems easiest.’  
> Feelings say, ‘That feels like the fair way to try.’  
> When all three work together, you solve problems wisely.”

### Practice A: In-Class Psychology Experiment – “The Tower Problem” (7 minutes)

**Objective:** Show that imagining multiple solutions leads to better problem-solving.  

**Setup:** Give each student (or pair) 10 building blocks or similar materials.  

**Steps:**
1. Challenge: “Build a tower five blocks tall that doesn’t fall over.”  
2. **First attempt:** Try once without planning (many will fail or succeed by chance).  
3. Pause and ask: “Before trying again, imagine three different ways to make it stronger.”  
4. **Second attempt:** Students rebuild after imagining possibilities first.  
5. **Debrief:** “Did imagining different ways help you solve the problem?”

**Key teaching point:** Imagining possibilities before acting helps your brain plan and solve problems more effectively.

### Practice B: MindMaster In-Class Game – “Problem-Solving Possibilities” (7 minutes)

**Game Format:** Multiple Choice (Individual gameplay via clicker)

**Game Flow:**
1. **Setup:** Each student has a clicker. The teacher presents four short scenarios on screen (one at a time).  
   - **Scenario 1:** “Your drawing got wet and the colours ran together. What could you try?”  
  A) Start a new drawing  
  B) Paint over it  
  C) Use it as a background for something new  
  D) Any of these could work ✅  
   - **Scenario 2:** “You want to play with a toy, but another child has it. What could you try?”  
  A) Wait for your turn  
  B) Suggest playing together  
  C) Find a different toy  
  D) Any of these could work ✅  
   - **Scenario 3 & 4:** Similar everyday challenges with multiple valid solutions.
2. **Play:** Students click the number of the answer they think would work.  
3. **Scoring:** Teacher displays class results as a bar graph. No single correct answer; celebrate variety.  
4. **Win Condition:** Everyone “wins” by recognising that problems often have multiple valid solutions.

**Timing note:** Play after Explore A and B to consolidate understanding.

### Practice C: “What Else Could I Try?” Reflection (4 minutes)

**Activity:** Hard copy worksheet or quick group discussion  

Present 2–3 simple problem cards (or draw them on the board):  
1️⃣ “Your block tower keeps falling.”  
2️⃣ “You want to paint but the paint is all gone.”  
3️⃣ “You want to play but you’re tired.”

For each, ask:  
> “What are two different things you could try?”

Write several ideas per problem on the board.  
**Closing:** “When you imagine ‘What else could I try?’ you don’t feel stuck. You feel like you have choices. That’s imagination as a superpower for problem-solving.”

## Psychology Video (1–2 minutes)

**Title:** “Problem-Solving for Kids” or “How to Find Different Solutions”  
**Suggested link:** Search YouTube for “problem solving for kids” or “creative thinking for children” (Crash Course Kids / Khan Academy Kids).

**Note:** This video is indicative only. In the full MindMaster version, a modified or copyright-free video will be produced or featured to illustrate the same concept.  

**Purpose:** Reinforces how imagination helps generate multiple solutions and builds flexible thinking.  
**Timing:** Play after Practice B.

## In-Class Quiz (MindMaster) – “Problem-Solving Smarts” *(Not timed)*

**Quiz Format:** Multiple Choice + True/False (3 questions)

1. “Imagination helps us solve problems because it lets us…”  
 A) Picture possibilities before we try them ✅  
 B) Know what will definitely work  
 C) Avoid trying new things  

2. “True or False: There is usually only one right way to solve a problem.”  
 A) True  
 B) False ✅

## Reflection (5 minutes)

**Activity:** “Reflection via MindMaster – My Problem-Solving”

Display three reflection questions on screen one at a time:
1️⃣ “Did you learn something new about solving problems today?”  
 A) Yes, definitely  
 B) A little bit  
 C) Not sure  
2️⃣ “When you face a tricky problem, will you try imagining different solutions?”  
 A) Yes  
 B) Maybe  
 C) I don’t think so

**Feedback:** After each question, show class bar graph results and invite a few students to explain their choices.

**Closing statement:**  
> “Today you learned that imagination isn’t just for stories—it’s a tool that helps you solve problems by showing you new possibilities. When you feel stuck, your imagination says, ‘What else could I try?’ That makes your mind stronger.”

## Home Prep (5 minutes)

**Teacher guides students:**

> “Tonight, if you face a tricky problem at home—like a toy that’s broken or a game that isn’t working—imagine two different things you could try before you ask for help. Tell your family what you imagined.”

**Bridge to next lesson:**  
> “Next time, we’ll learn how sharing our stories and imaginations helps us understand and connect with each other.”

## Connection to Unit Arc
Lessons 1–2 established imagination as a cognitive capacity and showed how storytelling structures it. Lesson 3 applies imagination to practical problem-solving, showing its power as a resilience tool. Lesson 4 will complete the unit by showing how sharing stories creates empathy and connection.
