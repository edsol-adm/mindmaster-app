# Lesson 4: Stories Connect Us to Each Other

## Lesson Objective
Students will understand that sharing stories allows people to step into each other's perspectives, build empathy, and create connection across differences. They will recognise both storytelling and listening as important for building community and belonging.

---

## Warm-Up (5 minutes)

**Activity:** “Story Bridge”

Tell students:  
> “I’m going to tell you a very short story. Listen carefully.”

> “One day, a child found a smooth rock by the river. They decided to paint it blue.  
> Their friend asked, ‘Why blue?’  
> The child said, ‘Because blue is calm, like water.’  
> Then the friend painted their own rock blue too.”

Ask:  
> “What did you learn about the first child from their story? What did the blue rock mean to them?”

Guide them:  
> “When someone shares a story, you get to step inside their mind.  
> You see what they see, feel what they feel. That’s what makes stories so powerful for connecting.”

## Explore + Practice (30 minutes)

### Explore A: Stories as Windows into Other Minds (6 minutes)

**Materials:** Hard copy – simple visual showing:  
- A box labelled “Inside their mind/story”  
- An arrow pointing to “Understanding”  
- Examples: “They love blue because it’s calm,” “They wanted to share with a friend.”

Explain:  
> “Stories are like windows. When someone tells you a story, you can look through that window into their mind.  
> You see what they were thinking about, what they cared about, what they felt.”

**Model:**  
> “If a child tells me, ‘I was scared of the dark, but my cat sat with me and I felt brave,’  
> I learn something about that child — they were scared, they have a cat, and the cat helped them.  
> I understand them better.”

**Key teaching point:** Stories help us understand each other. Understanding builds connection — that’s what communities are built on.

### Explore B: Listening Is as Important as Telling (6 minutes)

**Materials:** Hard copy – two-sided visual or two posters.  
- **Side 1 (TELLING):** “Sharing your story helps others understand you.”  
- **Side 2 (LISTENING):** “Listening to others’ stories helps you understand them.”

Explain:  
> “Storytelling has two parts: telling and listening.  
> When you tell a story, you say, ‘This is what I think and feel.’  
> When you listen, you say, ‘I want to understand you.’  
> Listening is a gift you give to someone else.”

Ask:  
> “Which is harder for you—telling or listening? Both are important, and both take practice.”

**Key teaching point:** Everyone has a valuable story, and everyone deserves to be heard.

### Practice A: Short Psychology Video – Empathy & Understanding (1–2 minutes)

**Title:** “What Is Empathy?” or “Understanding Others’ Feelings”  
**Suggested link:** Search YouTube for “empathy for kids” or “understanding feelings” (StoryBots / Brené Brown / similar).

**Note:** This video is indicative only. In the full MindMaster version, a modified or copyright-free video will be produced or featured to illustrate the same concept.

**Purpose:** Demonstrates empathy through listening and shows that stories are tools for understanding feelings.  
**Timing:** After Explore B.

---

### Practice B: In-Class Psychology Experiment – “Story Listening & Understanding” (via MindMaster)

**Objective:** Show that listening to a story helps us understand someone’s perspective.

**Game Flow:**
1. **Setup:** Teacher reads or plays a short 30-second story:  
   > “My name is Maya. I love building with blocks.  
   > Today I made a tall tower, but someone knocked it over by accident.  
   > I felt sad at first, but then I realised I could build something different next time.  
   > Now I’m excited to try a new design.”
2. **Play Part 1:** Story is read once; students just listen.  
3. **Play Part 2:** Questions appear on screen:  
   - “What does Maya like to do?” → ✅ Building with blocks  
   - “How did Maya feel when the tower was knocked over?” → ✅ Sad at first, then excited to try again  
   - “What did you learn about Maya from her story?” → ✅ She can try new ideas even when things don’t work  
4. **Scoring:** Teacher notes individual responses.  
5. **Win Condition:** Students discover that by listening to a story, they learned about another person’s thoughts and feelings — empathy in action.

**Key debrief:**  
> “You listened to Maya’s story and learned how she felt and what she valued.  
> That’s what happens when we listen — we understand each other better.”

### Practice C: “My Story, Your Story” – Peer Sharing Circle (12 minutes)

**Activity:** Small-group storytelling and listening  
**Materials:** Story-starter cards or prompts.

**Prompts:**  
- “Tell us about something you made or built.”  
- “Tell us about a time you felt brave.”  
- “Tell us about a friend or family member you care about.”  
- “Tell us about something you imagined.”  
- “Tell us about a time you solved a problem.”

**Procedure:**
1. **Model (2 min):** Teacher shares a short personal story using a prompt, demonstrating clear structure and calm tone.  
2. **Practice (8 min):**  
   - Students form groups of 4–5 or a whole-class circle.  
   - Each student tells a 1–2 minute story.  
   - Listeners maintain eye contact and quiet focus.  
   - After each story, listeners respond briefly: “I liked that part about …” or “That reminds me of …”.  
3. **Whole-class debrief (2 min):** “When you heard someone’s story, did you learn something new about them? Did it help you feel closer?”

**Pedagogy note:** The circle models respectful listening and shared vulnerability—core elements of empathy.

### Practice D: In-Class Game (MindMaster) – “Story Spot Connection” (5 minutes)

**Game Format:** Matching Pairs / Scenario to Feeling (Individual clicker gameplay)

**Game Flow:**
1. **Setup:** Story snippets appear on screen one at a time.  
2. **Examples:**  
   - “I painted a picture of my family.” → What is this story about? → ✅ Something the person cares about.  
   - “I tried to build a birdhouse but it fell apart. I felt frustrated.” → What can we understand? → ✅ The person likes building and keeps trying.  
   - “My friend was sad, so I sat next to her.” → What does this tell us? → ✅ The person understands how to help.  
3. **Play:** Students click the answer that best matches each story.  
4. **Scoring:** Bar graph shows class results.  
5. **Win Condition:** Everyone wins by recognising that stories reveal how people think and feel.

**Timing note:** Play after Practice C to reinforce empathy through story understanding.

## In-Class Quiz (MindMaster) – “Stories Connect Us” *(Not timed)*

**Quiz Format:** Multiple Choice + True/False (4 questions)

1. “Stories are like …” → ✅ Windows into other people’s minds  
2. “When you listen to someone’s story, you …” → ✅ Learn about what they think and feel  
3. “True or False: Both telling and listening are important for connection.” → ✅ True  
4. “What does empathy mean?” → ✅ To understand what someone else feels

**Presentation:** One question per screen; students respond via clicker.  
**Feedback:** Teacher reveals correct answers and links to empathy theme.
