# Lesson 2: Storytelling – Turning Ideas Into Stories

## Lesson Objective
Students will understand that storytelling gives imaginative ideas a structure—with a beginning, middle, and end—that makes them easier to understand, remember, and share with others. They will create a short story using that structure.

---

## Warm-Up (5 minutes)

**Activity:** “Story or Not?”

Tell students:  
> “I’m going to say two things. You tell me which one is a story.”

Example 1: “A cat is orange. A cat jumps. A cat sleeps.”  
Example 2: “A cat named Whiskers saw a bird outside. She jumped at the window to catch it, but the bird flew away. Whiskers curled up and dreamed of chasing birds in her sleep.”

Ask: “Which one felt like a story? Why?”

Guide them:  
> “A story has a beginning (here’s our cat), a middle (something happens), and an end (how it turned out). Stories are imagination shaped into a structure that makes sense.”

## Explore + Practice (30 minutes)

### Explore A: The Three Parts of a Story (7 minutes)
**Materials:** Hard copy – large visual showing three connected boxes  
**Labels:**  
1️⃣ Beginning – Who / Where  
2️⃣ Middle – What happens  
3️⃣ End – How it finishes  

Explain:  
> “Every story has three main parts, like a sandwich.  
> – The beginning introduces the characters and where we are.  
> – The middle is where something happens—maybe a problem, an adventure, or a surprise.  
> – The end tells us how it all turns out.  
>  
> Imagination gives us the ideas. Story structure gives those ideas a shape so people can understand and remember them.”

**Example:**  
“Little Red Riding Hood” – Beginning: a girl walks through the forest with a basket.  
Middle: she meets a wolf.  
End: she reaches Grandmother’s house safely.

**Key teaching point:** Stories help our brains organise thoughts and feelings into something that makes sense. When we share a story, other people can understand our imagination.

### Explore B: Stories Can Be Real, Imagined, or Mixed (5 minutes)
**Materials:** Hard copy – three labelled examples  
- Real event: “I went to the park yesterday.”  
- Imagined story: “A dragon visits the school.”  
- Mixed story: “I went to the park and found a magical door in a tree.”  

Explain:  
> “Stories don’t have to be all real or all imaginary. Some are about things that really happened, some are completely made up, and some mix both.”

Ask: “Which type do you like to tell or hear?” (Accept all answers.)

### Practice A: Short Psychology Video – Story Structure (1–2 minutes)

**Title:** “How to Tell a Story” or “The Three Parts of a Story”  
**Suggested link:** Search YouTube for “story structure for kids” – choose a short, animated explanation (StoryBots, Crash Course Kids, etc.).  

**Note:** This video is indicative only. In the full MindMaster version, a modified or copyright-free video will be produced or featured to illustrate the same concept.  

**Purpose:** Models the story-structure pattern visually and connects to students’ own story-building.  
**Timing:** After Explore B.

---

### Practice B: In-Class Psychology Experiment – “Story Sequencing Recall Experiment” (via MindMaster)

**Objective:** Show that stories with structure are easier to remember than random facts.

**Game Flow:**
1. **Setup:** Two groups of sentences appear on screen:  
 **Group A:** Random facts (e.g., “A dog is brown. Trees have leaves. Rain is wet.”)  
 **Group B:** Story order (e.g., “A dog ran into the forest. It started to rain. The dog went home and dried off.”)
2. **Play Part 1:** Show each group for 15 seconds; students just observe.  
3. **Play Part 2:** Ask via clicker:  
 a) “Which group do you remember better?” (A or B) → ✅ B  
 b) “Can you tell me one thing you remember from Group B?” (multiple-choice options).  
4. **Scoring:** Teacher notes how many students remember the structured story better.  
5. **Win Condition:** Students discover that structured information (stories) is easier to remember than unrelated facts.  

**Key debrief:** “See how your brain remembered the story better? That’s because stories have structure—a beginning, middle, and end. Your brain loves structure because it helps it organise information.”

---

### Practice C: Create & Share a Short Story (12 minutes)
**Activity:** “Story in a Circle” (hard copy or collaborative)  
**Materials:** Large paper or whiteboard / simple storyboard template (three boxes).

**Procedure:**
1. **Model (2 minutes):** Teacher creates a simple three-part story on the board using student input.  
 – Character (e.g., penguin or robot)  
 – Setting (e.g., ice, city)  
 – What happens / Ending  
2. **Practice (10 minutes):** Students work in pairs or groups to create a three-part story using pictures, cut-outs, or movement.  
3. **Optional Share:** 1–2 pairs present their story structure (beginning-middle-end).

**Pedagogy note:** Making and sharing a mini-story lets students apply structure actively and build confidence in expression.

## In-Class Quiz (MindMaster) – “Story Parts Check” *(Not timed)*

**Quiz Format:** Multiple Choice (4 questions)

1. “A story has which three parts?” → ✅ Beginning, middle, end  
2. “What happens in the beginning of a story?” → ✅ We meet the characters and learn where we are  
3. “Which type of story can mix real and imaginary ideas?” → ✅ Stories can mix real and imaginary  
4. “Stories help our brains because …” → ✅ They organise ideas into a structure we can remember  

**Presentation:** One question per screen; students respond via clicker.  
**Feedback:** Teacher reveals answers and connects to lesson.  
**Scoring:** Teacher tracks individual scores.  
**Win Condition:** 3 or more correct = success; celebrate learning.

---

## Reflection (5 minutes)

**Activity:** “Reflection via MindMaster – Story Parts”

Display three questions one at a time:  
1. “Which part of a story did you enjoy creating today?” (A–D: Beginning / Middle / End / All three)  
2. “Do you think you’ll tell a story today or tomorrow?” (A–C: Yes / Maybe / Not sure)  
3. “Stories are easier to remember than random ideas. Do you agree?” (A–C: Agree / Not sure / Disagree)

After each, show class results (bar graph) and invite 1–2 students to explain why they chose their answer.

**Closing statement:** “You’ve learned that imagination creates ideas, and storytelling organises those ideas so others can understand and remember them. Next lesson we’ll see how imagination also helps solve problems.”

---

## Home Prep (5 minutes)

**Teacher guides students:**

> “Tonight, tell your family a story about something that happened today—or make one up. Remember the three parts: beginning, middle, end. See if they can spot those parts!  
> Tomorrow, we’ll learn how imagination helps us solve problems and find new ideas when things are tricky.”

## Connection to Unit Arc
Lesson 1 introduced imagination as a mental capacity. Lesson 2 shows how storytelling structures that imagination into shareable narratives. This prepares students for Lesson 3, where imagination becomes a tool for problem-solving and resilience.
