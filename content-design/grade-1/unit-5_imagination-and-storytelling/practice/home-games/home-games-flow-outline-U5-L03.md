### Learning Objective
Students will understand that imagination allows the mind to picture possibilities, test ideas mentally, and generate more than one solution to a challenge before choosing one.

### Game File Name & Format
`hg-05.03-01.html` — Maze Game (Standard format - adapted)

### Game Purpose
This game reinforces that imagination is a practical problem-solving tool by physically demonstrating multiple solution paths. Students practice "mental flexibility" by exploring different approaches, discovering that problems rarely have only one correct answer.

### Estimated Play Time
10–12 minutes (5 mazes × 2-2.5 minutes each, including replays for different paths)

  “When you face a tricky problem, your imagination can find many different ways forward! In these mazes, there isn't just one path—there are several good solutions. Can you find them all?”  
- Instructions: “Guide your character through the maze. Each fork is a different solution. Explore all paths to collect solution tokens!”  
- Maze overview shows branching structure with multiple endpoints  
- Start button appears

### Play
**Game Structure (5 problem mazes):**  
Each maze represents a real-life problem with multiple solution paths. Players must explore different routes to understand that flexibility creates resilience.

**Maze Mechanics:**  
- Top-down view of maze (bird's eye perspective)  
- Player controls character with arrow keys (desktop) or swipe gestures (mobile/tablet)  
- Maze has 1 start point at bottom, multiple branching paths, 3-4 solution endpoints at top  
- Must collect solution tokens along each path  
- Can restart maze to try different paths  
- No time pressure - encourages thorough exploration

---

### Continuity Note
This game directly applies Lesson 3's teaching that imagination is a practical problem-solving tool. The maze format makes the abstract concept of "multiple solutions" concrete—students physically experience that different paths lead to success.

The exploration mechanic reinforces resilience: when one path is blocked or doesn't work, you can always try another route. This prepares students for Lesson 4 by demonstrating that multiple perspectives exist (just as multiple solution paths exist)—the same mental flexibility they'll use to understand different people's stories and viewpoints in the next lesson.

### Win Condition
Player completes all 5 challenge experiments by testing solutions and making choices. A celebration screen appears showing:
- "Master Experimenter" badge (or level achieved)  
- Total gems earned  
- Lab report summary: "You tested [X] solutions across 5 challenges!"  
- Scientist certificate with name  

**Completion Message:**  
"You're a Master Experimenter! You discovered that imagination lets you 'see ahead'—you can test ideas in your mind before trying them in real life. This helps you make better choices and feel more confident when facing challenges. You tested [X] different solutions and learned that when one approach doesn't work, imagination gives you the power to ask 'What else could I try?' That's imagination building resilience and smart thinking!"

### Continuity Note
This game extends Lesson 3's "seeing ahead" concept by making mental simulation explicit and experiential. Players literally practice the cognitive skill of imagining consequences before acting. It prepares students for Lesson 4 by demonstrating that imagination helps us understand different perspectives and outcomes—the same empathy skill they'll use to understand others' stories and viewpoints.

## How Lesson 3 Fits into the Full Learning Arc
Lesson 3 advances imagination from **creative expression to adaptive application**. While Lessons 1 and 2 established imagination as the mind’s playground and taught students to give imaginative ideas structure through storytelling, Lesson 3 transforms imagination into a **practical resilience tool**. Here, children experience imagination as a thinking skill that helps them “see ahead,” test multiple possibilities, and adapt when one idea doesn’t work.

Through *Problem Maze* and *Imagination Lab*, students move from passive creativity to **strategic flexibility**—understanding that imagination is not just for fun or stories, but for real-world problem-solving. They discover that the ability to imagine different outcomes builds both confidence and persistence.

- **Lesson 1:** Imagination as cognitive capacity—how minds create ideas.  
- **Lesson 2:** Storytelling as structure—how imagination organizes expression.  
- **Lesson 3 (this lesson):** Imagination as flexible problem-solving—how it empowers action and resilience.  
- **Lesson 4:** Storytelling as empathy—how imagination connects minds and perspectives.

> 🧠 **Learning Arc Summary:** Imagination → Structure → Application → Connection.  
> Lesson 3 serves as the pivot point—bridging inner creativity and outward adaptability—showing students that flexible thinking and imaginative foresight are foundations of both problem-solving and psychological resilience.
