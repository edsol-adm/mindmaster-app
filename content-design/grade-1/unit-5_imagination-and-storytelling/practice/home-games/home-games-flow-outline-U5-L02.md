## Home Game 2A – Story Slider: Put It In Order
> Jump to: [Setup](#setup) · [Play](#play) · [Scoring](#scoring) · [Win Condition](#win-condition) · [Continuity Note](#continuity-note)

### Learning Objective
Students will understand that storytelling gives imaginative ideas structure (beginning, middle, end) that makes them easier to understand, remember, and share with others.

### Game File Name & Format
`hg-05.02-01.html` — Sliding Puzzle (Swap Tiles) (Standard format)

### Game Purpose
This game reinforces the three-part story structure through hands-on manipulation. By physically rearranging story panels, students practice identifying and ordering story elements, demonstrating how structure makes imagination communicable and memorable.

### Estimated Play Time
9–10 minutes (6 stories × 1.5 minutes each)

---

### Setup
**Opening Screen:**
- Title: "Story Slider: Put It In Order"  
- Background: A magical storybook workshop with three glowing pedestals labeled "BEGINNING," "MIDDLE," "END"  
- Guide character (Storyteller Sofia) appears:  
  "Stories are like puzzles! They have pieces that go in the right order. Can you slide the panels to make complete stories?"  
- Instructions: "Slide story panels into the correct spots: Beginning (who & where), Middle (what happens), End (how it finishes)."  
- Example animation shows a simple 3-panel story being rearranged  
- Start button appears

#### Gameplay Flow Per Puzzle
1. **Setup Phase**  
   Story title appears (e.g., "Maya's Kite").  
   Three illustrated panels load in scrambled order with one empty space.  
   Instruction reminder: "Slide panels into correct order."  
   Timer starts (optional pressure element for advanced players).  

2. **Sliding Phase**  
   Player taps panel adjacent to empty space.  
   Panel slides into empty space with smooth animation.  
   Empty space moves to where panel was.  
   Player continues sliding until satisfied with arrangement.  

3. **Check Answer**  
   "Check My Story" button glows when player is ready.  
   Player taps button.  
   Game checks if panels are in correct B–M–E order.  

4. **Feedback Phase**  
   - **If CORRECT:**  
     All panels glow green.  
     Panels animate together forming a "storybook."  
     Story plays as short animation (5–8 seconds).  
     Text appears: "Perfect! You built a complete story!"  
     Explanation: "The BEGINNING introduces Maya and the park. The MIDDLE shows the problem (stuck kite). The END tells how it turned out (friend helped)."  
     Player earns 3 stars (or 2 if multiple attempts).  

   - **If INCORRECT:**  
     Incorrect panels flash yellow.  
     Hint appears based on mistake:  
       - If beginning wrong: "The BEGINNING introduces the character and setting. Who and where?"  
       - If middle wrong: "The MIDDLE shows what happens—the action or problem."  
       - If end wrong: "The END tells how the story finishes."  
     "Try Again" button appears.  
     Player rearranges and resubmits.  
     Player earns 2 stars on second try, 1 on third.  

5. **Understanding Check**  
   After solving, quick question appears:  
   “Why does this story make sense in this order?”  
   - A) Because the pictures are pretty  
   - B) Because the beginning-middle-end structure helps our brain understand what happened ✅  
   - C) Because stories are always short  
   Feedback: "Yes! Structure helps your brain organize information. That's why stories with beginning-middle-end are easy to remember!"  
   Bonus star for correct answer.  

6. **Next Story**  
   "Next Story" button appears.  
   Story completion tracker updates: "Stories Solved: X/6."  
   New puzzle loads.

### Continuity Note
This game extends Lesson 2 by giving students creative autonomy while reinforcing structure. It prepares them for Lesson 3 by showing that storytelling involves making choices—the same decision-making process they'll use for problem-solving. The variety of story types (real/imagined/mixed) demonstrates imagination's flexibility, which will be applied to generating multiple solutions in the next lesson.

## How Lesson 2 Fits into the Full Learning Arc

Lesson 2 deepens Unit 5’s cognitive progression by showing that **storytelling gives structure to imagination**. Where Lesson 1 introduced imagination as a free mental playground, Lesson 2 transforms that creative energy into something organized and communicable. Students learn that stories are how minds make sense of their ideas—organizing memory, thinking, and feelings into a meaningful beginning, middle, and end. Through the two home games, this abstract concept becomes concrete: *Story Slider* builds story structure physically, while *Story Paths* lets students see how different choices shape different story outcomes.

Together, these games mark a key shift—from *imagining* to *expressing*. Students experience how imagination becomes understandable when it gains structure, and how stories can be both real and invented, blending creativity with coherence. This cognitive framing prepares them for Lesson 3, where imagination becomes a deliberate tool for problem-solving, and Lesson 4, where storytelling becomes a bridge to understanding others.

> 🧠 **Learning Arc Summary:**  
> Imagination (Lesson 1) → Structured Expression (Lesson 2) → Practical Application (Lesson 3) → Social Connection (Lesson 4).  
> Through this arc, students discover that imagination is not chaos but a creative system—one that helps minds think flexibly, communicate clearly, and connect meaningfully with others.
