## Home Game 1A – Imagination Mix-Up: Match & Create
> Jump to: [Setup](#setup) · [Play](#play) · [Scoring](#scoring) · [Win Condition](#win-condition) · [Continuity Note](#continuity-note)

### Learning Objective
Students will understand that imagination is a mental capacity—the mind's ability to create pictures, ideas, and possibilities that are not right in front of them. They will recognize how imagination connects with memory, thinking, and feelings to create new ideas.

### Game File Name & Format
`hg-05.01-01.html` — Match-3 Puzzle (Puzzle format)

### Game Purpose
This game reinforces that imagination uses three mental capacities working together—memory (content), thinking (organization), and feelings (meaning). By matching elements from each category, students discover how combining these creates new imaginative ideas.

### Estimated Play Time
8–10 minutes (5 creations × ~1.5–2 minutes each)

---

### Setup
**Opening Screen:**
- Title: "Imagination Mix-Up: Match & Create"  
- Background: A vibrant "Mind's Playground" with three glowing zones (blue for Memory, green for Thinking, yellow for Feelings)  
- A cheerful guide character (Sam the Imagination Explorer) appears:  
  “Your imagination is like a puzzle! When you match memory, thinking, and feelings together, you create amazing new ideas. Let's play!”  
- Instructions: “Match 3 or more tiles of the same type. When you match all three types together, watch the magic happen!”  
- An 8×8 puzzle grid appears filled with colorful tiles from three categories  
- Start button appears  

---

### Play

#### Tile Categories (evenly distributed across grid):
**Memory Tiles (Blue):**  
Balloon, Tree, Beach, Dog, Book, Star, Flower, Bicycle, Cloud, House  

**Thinking Tiles (Green):**  
Flying, Underwater, Giant, Rainbow, Spinning, Invisible, Talking, Glowing  

**Feeling Tiles (Yellow):**  
Happy face, Excited face, Curious face, Calm face, Surprised face, Brave face  

---

#### Game Mechanics

**Phase 1: Basic Matching (Rounds 1–3)**  
**Grid Setup:**  
- 8×8 grid with randomly placed tiles from all three categories  
- Tiles can be swapped horizontally or vertically with adjacent tiles  
- Match 3+ tiles of same type to clear them  

**Matching Action:**  
- Player taps/clicks a tile, then taps adjacent tile to swap  
- If swap creates a line of 3+ matching tiles, they disappear with sparkle animation  
- New tiles fall from top to fill empty spaces  
- Each match earns points:  
  - 3 tiles = 10 points  
  - 4 tiles = 20 points  
  - 5+ tiles = 30 points + bonus gem  

**Special Matches:**  
- Match 4 in a row = creates "Power Tile" that clears entire row/column when matched  
- Match 5 in L or T shape = creates "Rainbow Tile" that clears all tiles of one type  

---

**Phase 2: Imagination Creation (Triggered by collecting sets)**  
**Set Collection Mechanic:**  
- As player matches tiles, they collect them in three "ingredient jars" at top of screen:  
  - Memory Jar (blue)  
  - Thinking Jar (green)  
  - Feeling Jar (yellow)  

**Creation Trigger:**  
- When player collects at least 3 of EACH type (9 total tiles minimum), a "Create!" button glows  
- Player taps "Create!" button  
- The three ingredients swirl together in center screen  
- An imaginative combination appears with animation and narration  

**Imagination Combinations (Examples):**  
- Memory (Dog) + Thinking (Flying) + Feeling (Excited) = “A flying dog soaring joyfully through clouds!”  
- Memory (Beach) + Thinking (Giant) + Feeling (Curious) = “A giant beach with enormous seashells to explore!”  
- Memory (Star) + Thinking (Talking) + Feeling (Happy) = “Chattering stars telling funny stories in the sky!”  

**After Creation:**  
- Combination is saved to player's "Imagination Gallery"  
- Player earns 3 gems  
- Grid resets with new tiles  
- Player continues matching to create more combinations  

---

#### Goal Structure
- Complete 5 rounds (create 5 imaginative combinations)  
- Each round requires collecting enough tiles to trigger one creation  
- Rounds get slightly faster as player progresses  

**Round Progression:**  
- Round 1: Tutorial mode – guide shows how to match and create (slower pace)  
- Round 2–3: Standard matching speed  
- Round 4–5: Slightly faster tile falling speed; introduces more Power Tiles  

---

### Scoring
**Points System:**  
- 3-tile match: 10 points  
- 4-tile match: 20 points  
- 5+-tile match: 30 points

- Bonus 5 gems for completing all 5 creations  

**Total Maximum:**  
- Points: 500+ (varies by gameplay)  
- Gems: 30+ (15 from creations + bonuses + combos)  

**Performance Badges:**  
- "Imagination Mixer" – Complete 3 creations  
- "Creative Combiner" – Complete all 5 creations  
- "Match Master" – Make 10 power tile matches  
- "Ultimate Imagination Explorer" – Score 500+ points

A celebration screen appears showing:  
- Total gems earned  
- “Creative Combiner” badge  
- Gallery of all 5 created imaginative combinations (can tap to replay animations)

---

### Continuity Note
This game establishes imagination as a cognitive capacity that integrates memory, thinking, and feelings—the foundation for Unit 5. It prepares students for Lesson 2 by showing them they can generate creative ideas, which they'll soon learn to organize into structured stories with beginning, middle, and end.

### Continuity Note
This game reinforces Lesson 1's concept that imagination is a practical mental capacity present in daily life, not just fantasy. It connects to Lesson 2 by showing that imagination appears in storytelling contexts (like the child imagining what's inside the gift, which is the start of a story). Students learn to recognize imagination as an active cognitive process they can observe and use intentionally.

## How Lesson 1 Fits into the Full Learning Arc

Lesson 1 introduces **imagination as the mind’s playground**—a cognitive space where memory, thinking, and feelings combine to create ideas beyond what is immediately visible. The two home games turn this into lived experience: *Imagination Mix-Up* makes the invisible process of combining mind parts tangible, while *Imagination Detective* grounds imagination in real life, showing it as an everyday mental skill rather than mere fantasy.

- **Lesson 1 (this document):** Establishes imagination as an integrated cognitive capacity connecting memory, thinking, and feelings.  
- **Lesson 2:** Builds on this foundation by showing how imagination becomes *structured* through storytelling, turning ideas into shareable narratives.  
- **Lesson 3:** Extends imagination’s function toward *problem-solving*—using it as a flexible mental tool to generate multiple possible solutions.  
- **Lesson 4:** Expands imagination into the *social realm*, highlighting storytelling as a bridge for empathy, communication, and shared understanding.  

> 🧠 **Learning Arc Summary:** Cognitive Capacity → Structured Expression → Practical Application → Social Connection.  
> Through this arc, students come to see imagination not as escapism but as a powerful, everyday mental function—one that supports creativity, problem-solving, and belonging. Recognizing imagination as both an inner strength and a social tool builds psychological literacy, self-efficacy, and emotional connection with others.
