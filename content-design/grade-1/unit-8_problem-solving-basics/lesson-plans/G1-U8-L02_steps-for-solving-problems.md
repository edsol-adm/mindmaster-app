# Lesson 2: Steps for Solving Problems

## Lesson Objective
Students will learn and apply a clear, four-step problem-solving framework:  
**Stop and Notice → Think of Options → Choose One → Try It Out.**  
They will practise using this process on small, familiar situations through role-play and guided games, realising that following steps makes problem-solving feel less overwhelming and builds confidence.

## Warm-Up (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *“Quick Problem-Solver Moves”*  

Arrange students in a standing circle.  

Say:  
> “Imagine your pencil is dull and you need to write. What do you do?”  

Take quick shout-outs (sharpen it, borrow one, ask for new, etc.).  

Then ask:  
> “Did you stop and think first, or did you just react?”  

Guide toward:  
> “Our brains are fast—but when we stop and think, we get smarter answers. Today we’re learning the four brain-moves that all problem-solvers use.”

**Psychology Frame:**  
> “Our brains can use a process just like scientists do. Instead of rushing, we’ll follow steps that help us test and choose ideas carefully.”

## Explore + Practice (30 minutes total)

### Explore A: Introducing the Four-Step Model (5 min)

**Materials:** Large poster or slide with icons  

🛑 **Stop and Notice** – Pause. What is the problem?  
💭 **Think of Options** – Imagine. What could I do?  
✅ **Choose One** – Decide. Which option seems best?  
🎯 **Try It Out** – Act. See what happens.  

**Teacher Demonstration:**  
Use a simple example: two friends want the same red crayon.  

> “First we **Stop and Notice**: Two friends, one crayon—that’s the problem.  
> Next we **Think of Options**: take turns, share, use another colour, ask the teacher.  
> Then we **Choose One** that feels fair: taking turns.  
> Finally we **Try It Out** and see if it works.”  

Emphasise: slowing down and using steps helps the brain plan before acting—“That’s what scientists do!”

### Practice A: Role-Play Problem Solving (10 min)

**Materials:** 3–4 printed scenario cards  

- Two students want to be line leader.  
- You want to paint but all brushes are used.  
- Someone accidentally breaks a game piece.  
- You want to play tag but friends prefer hopscotch.  

**Activity Flow**  
1️⃣ Divide the class into four groups (or pairs).  
2️⃣ Each group gets one scenario.  
3️⃣ **Group Prep (3 min):** Students plan a short skit showing all four steps.  
 – One student voices the “Stop and Notice.”  
 – Another suggests ideas (“Think of Options”).  
 – Group decides which to “Choose.”  
 – They act the “Try It Out.”  
4️⃣ **Perform (30 sec each).**  
5️⃣ After each, ask:  
 – “What was the problem?”  
 – “What options did they think of?”  
 – “Which one did they choose?”  
 – “What happened?”  
6️⃣ Conclude:  
> “Each group used the same four steps, and they worked—even for different problems. That’s the power of having a process.”

**Science Frame:**  
> “Role-play is how scientists test ideas. You just tested whether the four-step model helps—and it does!”

### Practice B: MindMaster Quiz – “Do You Know the Steps?” (6 min)

**Format:** Multiple Choice (4–5 questions)  

**Sample Questions:**  
1️⃣ “What is the **first** step?” → (A) Think of Options  (B) Stop and Notice ✅ (C) Choose One  
2️⃣ “Which step is when you imagine ideas?” → (B) Think of Options ✅  
3️⃣ “What is the **last** step?” → (C) Try It Out ✅  
4️⃣ “What does ‘Stop and Notice’ help your mind do?” → (B) See the problem clearly ✅  

**Game Flow:**  
- Questions appear on screen with three options.  
- Students answer via clickers.  
- After each, display correct answer and explanation.  
- Score = +1 per correct.  

**Feedback Line:**  
> “Right! Thinking of options is when we let our brain imagine different choices.”  

**Win Condition:** Most correct answers = “Problem-Solver Star!”  
Celebrate effort from all.

**When in Lesson:** After Practice A role-plays to check comprehension before deeper application.

### Practice C: Psychology Experiment – “Four-Step Speed Test” (6 min)

**Type:** Interactive MindMaster Experiment  
**Objective:** Students experience how following steps clarifies decisions.

**Setup & Game Flow:**  
1️⃣ Display a simple scenario:  
 “Your friend borrowed your toy and forgot to return it. What do you do?”  
2️⃣ **Round 1 – Stop and Notice:** “What is the problem?”  
 Options: (A) Friend forgot toy ✅ (B) I don’t like my friend (C) I’m hungry.  
3️⃣ **Round 2 – Think of Options:** “What could you do?”  
 (A) Ask for it back  (B) Shout  (C) Tell teacher — all acceptable.  
4️⃣ **Round 3 – Choose One:** Show prior choices; students select the best fit.  
5️⃣ **Round 4 – Try It Out:** “You chose [option]. What might happen?”  
 (A) Friend returns toy ✅ (B) Friend upset (C) You figure it out together.  
6️⃣ Scoring = 1 point per step; bonus for respectful choices.  
7️⃣ Final Screen: “You just used the four-step model! Notice how steps make problems easier to solve.”  

**When in Lesson:** End of Explore + Practice—capstone activity.  
**Science Frame:**  
> “Scientists test models by using them. You just tested a thinking model and proved it works!”

## Reflection (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *“You Are a Four-Step Problem-Solver”*  

Gather students in a circle.  

Ask sequentially:  
- “Why do you think stopping and noticing **first** helps?” → “It slows your brain so you can think clearly.”  
- “What’s the difference between thinking of one option and thinking of many?” → “More options = more chances to solve it.”  
- “When you try it out, does it always work perfectly?” → “No—and that’s OK! That’s what next lesson is about.”  
- “Who in this room is now a four-step problem-solver?” (Raise hands & celebrate.)

**Teacher Closing:**  
> “You’ve learned a process your brain can use anywhere—at school, at home, or with friends. That’s powerful!”

## Home Prep (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *“Find a Small Problem Tonight and Use the Steps”*  

**Teacher Explanation:**  
> “Tonight, when you notice a small problem—like finding your shoes or deciding what snack to eat—try the four steps.”  

Display reminder on board:  
1️⃣ Stop and Notice – Name the problem.  
2️⃣ Think of Options – Say 2–3 ideas.  
3️⃣ Choose One – Pick one.  
4️⃣ Try It Out – See what happens.  

Next day: Ask students to share their experience and which step helped most.  
*Encourage family participation if possible.*

## Connection to Unit Arc
Lesson 1 normalised problems; Lesson 2 now provides a **clear framework** to act on them.  
This transition moves students from awareness (“Problems are normal”) to strategy (“Here’s how to solve them”).  
Lesson 3 will extend Step 2—**Think of Options**—by teaching that there are often multiple creative solutions.
