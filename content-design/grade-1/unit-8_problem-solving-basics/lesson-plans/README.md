# Grade 1 · Unit 8 — Problems Are Part of Life

**Purpose**  
This unit teaches children that **problems are normal features of everyday life** and that the mind can approach them with curiosity and structure.  
Students learn that challenges are not signs of failure but *puzzles the brain can solve* using reasoning, creativity, persistence, and help-seeking.  

Through guided discovery, games, and experiments, they realise that:

- Problems are **a natural part of living and learning**.  
- There are **structured steps** for solving problems: *Stop and Notice → Think of Options → Choose One → Try It Out.*  
- Most problems have **more than one possible solution**.  
- When an idea doesn’t work, we **try again or ask for help**.  
- Persistence and collaboration make minds stronger and more confident.  

By exploring problems as scientists do—through observation, testing, and revision—children develop a growth mindset and the belief:  
> “I can face challenges, use my thinking tools, and find ways forward.”

**Theory of Change**  
> **Knowledge** — Students learn that problems are **everyday situations requiring thinking, feeling, and doing**. They see that identifying, analysing, and classifying problems is the first step toward solving them (Flavell; Vygotsky).  
> **→ Self-efficacy** — Through explicit modelling of the four-step framework and multiple guided practices, children discover that they can *choose strategies* and *influence outcomes*. Repeated success with small problems builds the belief “I can handle this” (Bandura; Zimmerman).  
> **→ Mental resilience** — When problems persist or first attempts fail, students practise *persistence* and *help-seeking*, learning that mistakes provide information. This reframes failure as feedback and builds perseverance, optimism, and social connectedness (Dweck; Masten).  

Together these stages move learners from **avoidance and frustration** to **agency and adaptive coping** — foundational capacities for lifelong psychological resilience.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this unit, students will be able to:

1. **Recognise** that problems are normal and appear in daily life.  
2. **Classify** problems by type or size (small, medium, bigger).  
3. **Apply** a structured four-step model to solve simple problems.  
4. **Generate** multiple possible solutions and compare which might work best.  
5. **Demonstrate persistence** and know when and how to ask for help.  
6. **Reflect** on what they learned from a problem that didn’t work out the first time.

## Lesson Sequence
1. **L01 — Problems Are Part of Life**  
   Normalising the concept of problems and learning to observe and categorise them without fear.  

2. **L02 — Steps for Solving Problems**  
   Introducing and practising the four-step framework: *Stop → Think → Choose → Try.*  

3. **L03 — Thinking of Different Solutions**  
   Strengthening flexible thinking by generating and evaluating multiple possible answers.  

4. **L04 — Keep Trying and Ask for Help**  
   Building persistence and collaboration when first attempts fail, turning mistakes into learning.

## Digital & Interactive Components (MindMaster)
- **Psychology Experiments** – Observation and testing tasks such as *What Problems Do You Notice?*, *Four-Step Speed Test*, and *Try Again, Scientist!* that let students study their own problem-solving behaviour.  
- **MindMaster Games** – Scenario-based clicker activities (*Sort the Problems*, *Multiple Solutions Explorer*, *Keep Trying Challenge*) transforming abstract strategies into playful practice.  
- **Quizzes** – True/False and multiple-choice checks that reinforce each step of the model.  
- **Reflections** – Guided clicker polls and class discussions (“How Do You Handle Disagreements?”, “Flexible Thinking Is a Strength”) linking experience to insight.  
- **Teacher Dashboard** – Visualises class progress in problem classification, strategy use, and persistence trends over time.

## Connection to Curriculum Arc
Unit 8 follows **Unit 7: Family and Friendship Dynamics**, where students learned cooperation and relationship repair.  
Now they extend those interpersonal insights into **intrapersonal strategy**—learning how to manage challenges independently and systematically.  

This unit represents a major developmental bridge:  
- From **social-emotional application** (relationships and teamwork)  
- To **executive function and self-management** (planning, decision-making, perseverance).  

Students develop:
- **Metacognitive awareness** – noticing how they approach challenges.  
- **Strategic control** – applying structured steps to guide action.  
- **Growth mindset** – viewing setbacks as opportunities to learn.  
- **Resilient collaboration** – recognising when to persist alone and when to seek help.  

Together, these capacities complete Grade 1’s first-year foundation in psychology literacy: moving from “How minds feel and connect” to “How minds think and adapt.”  
Unit 8 equips children with both the **framework and confidence** to face future academic and social challenges with scientific curiosity and calm persistence.
