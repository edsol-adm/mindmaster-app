## In-Class-Game 8A – Problem Size Sorter

**Lesson 1: Problems Are Part of Life**

### Lesson Link & Learning Objective

Students will categorize problems by size (small, medium, larger) and recognize that problems are normal, everyday experiences that everyone faces.

### Game File Name: icg-08.01-game01.html

### Game Title: ****Problem Size Sorter****

### Game Format: ****Classification Trees / Gallery****

**Format Justification:** This format allows students to actively classify problems into categories through a step-by-step decision-making process, directly reinforcing the lesson's core objective of categorizing problems by size. The gallery metaphor positions students as "problem scientists" who observe, analyze, and systematically categorize phenomena-aligning with the psychology-as-science framework. Unlike passive sorting, the tree/gallery structure requires students to make explicit decisions at each classification node, building metacognitive awareness of what features determine problem size (how many people affected, how hard to solve, how much help needed). This active classification process mirrors how psychologists categorize and study problems scientifically, making abstract categorization concrete and observable.

### Purpose: Students practice categorizing everyday problems as small, medium, or larger by examining problem scenarios and selecting which size category fits best. This reinforces that problems can be observed, analyzed, and systematically classified-treating problem-solving as a science

### Placement in Lesson Arc: Practice C (minutes 28-33). AFTER Practice B (In-Class Experiment where students identified their own problems). **BEFORE:** Reflection

**Pedagogical Rationale:** By minute 28, students have been introduced to problem categories through hands-on sorting with peers (Practice A) and have identified problems from their own lives (Practice B). The game serves as consolidation and individual mastery check-students now apply the categorization skill independently with immediate feedback. This placement allows the teacher to assess whether students can reliably distinguish problem sizes before moving to reflection, while the 5-minute duration maintains energy and engagement as a final practice activity before wind-down.

### Setup

**Opening Screen:**

- Background: Bright, clean "Problem Science Lab" with three large display cases labeled "SMALL," "MEDIUM," and "LARGER"
- Character: Friendly scientist avatar (cartoon style, lab coat, magnifying glass) named "Dr. Wonder"
- Text bubble from Dr. Wonder: "Welcome to the Problem Lab! Scientists sort problems by size. Let's practice!"
- Button 5 (center): "Start Sorting"

**First Interaction:**  
Student clicks Button 5 to begin Round 1.

### Play

**Round Structure:** 8 rounds total  
Each round follows this sequence:

**Step 1: Problem Scenario Presentation**

- Screen displays a problem scenario with simple illustration
- Text appears in large, clear font
- Dr. Wonder asks: "What SIZE is this problem?"
- Three classification buttons appear:
  - Button 1: "SMALL"
  - Button 5: "MEDIUM"
  - Button 9: "LARGER"

**Step 2: Student Response**

- Student selects one button
- Response is recorded in MindMaster system

**Step 3: Feedback & Explanation**

- Correct choice: Display case for that size glows, problem card "files" into it
  - Feedback text: "You classified it! \[Brief reason why it's that size\]"
- Incorrect choice: Gentle shake animation, no sound
  - Feedback text: "Look again. Think about: How many people? How hard to solve?"
  - Student can try again (no penalty)

**Step 4: Classification Reasoning**

- After correct answer, Dr. Wonder explains ONE classification clue:
  - Small problems: "This affects just one person and can be fixed quickly."
  - Medium problems: "This involves more than one person or needs some thinking."
  - Larger problems: "This affects many people or needs lots of help and time."

**Step 5: Next Round**

- Button 5: "Next Problem"
- Advances to next scenario

**Problem Scenarios (8 total):**

- **Scenario 1 (SMALL):** "You can't find your pencil."  
    Illustration: Child looking at empty desk
- **Scenario 2 (SMALL):** "Your shoelace is untied."  
    Illustration: Shoe with loose lace
- **Scenario 3 (MEDIUM):** "You and your friend both want to play with the same toy."  
    Illustration: Two children reaching for one toy
- **Scenario 4 (MEDIUM):** "You can't remember where you put your homework."  
    Illustration: Child looking puzzled, papers scattered
- **Scenario 5 (LARGER):** "You're starting at a new school and don't know anyone yet."  
    Illustration: Child standing alone near unfamiliar building
- **Scenario 6 (SMALL):** "You spilled a little water on your desk."  
    Illustration: Small puddle on desk
- **Scenario 7 (LARGER):** "Two friends in your class are both upset with each other and won't talk."  
    Illustration: Two children turned away from each other, third child in middle
- **Scenario 8 (MEDIUM):** "You want to build something but don't have all the pieces you need."  
    Illustration: Child with incomplete building blocks

**Classification Decision Tree Logic:**

The game uses implicit decision nodes students consider:

- **Node 1:** "How many people does this affect?" (1 person → lean Small; 2+ people → lean Medium/Larger)
- **Node 2:** "How much help or time is needed?" (Quick fix → Small; Some thinking → Medium; Lots of help → Larger)
- **Node 3:** "How hard is it to solve?" (Easy → Small; Takes work → Medium; Very challenging → Larger)

Students don't see these nodes explicitly but the feedback after each round highlights which factor made it that size.

### Scoring

**Point System:**

- **First-try correct:** 2 points
- **Second-try correct:** 1 point
- **Third-try correct:** 1 point (if needed)

**Progress Tracking:**

- Each correct answer adds a "problem card" to the appropriate display case
- Visual progress bar at top: "Problems Sorted: X/8"

**No Competition:**

- Individual scores displayed only to that student
- Focus on personal mastery: "You're becoming a problem scientist!"

### Win Condition

**Completion:**

- Student completes all 8 rounds (regardless of accuracy)
- No time pressure-students work at their own pace

**Success Screen:**

- All three display cases are full with sorted problem cards
- Dr. Wonder: "You sorted all 8 problems! You're thinking like a problem scientist!"
- Display student's final score: "You earned \[X\] points!"
- Fun fact appears: "Scientists know that every problem-small, medium, or large-can be understood and solved. You just practiced that skill!"

**Button Options:**

- Button 5: "Return to Class" → links to lesson-08.01.html
- Button 7: "Try Again" → restarts game with same scenarios (for practice)

### Continuity Note

**Link to Prior Learning:**  
This game builds on Unit 1 (three parts of the mind: Thinking, Feeling, Doing) by showing students that their Idea Factory can analyze and categorize problems systematically.

**Link to Future Learning:**  
Prepares students for Lesson 2, where they will learn the four-step problem-solving process. Understanding problem size helps students recognize that different problems may need different amounts of thinking, options, and help-concepts that will be explored in subsequent lessons.

## In-Class-Game 8B – Problem Path Builder

## Lesson 2: Steps for Solving Problems

### Lesson Link & Learning Objective

Students will learn and apply a clear, four-step problem-solving framework: Stop and Notice → Think of Options → Choose One → Try It Out. They will understand that following steps makes problem-solving feel less overwhelming and that the goal is to have a plan to try, not to find a perfect answer immediately.

### Game File Name: icg-08.02-game01.html

### **Game Title: **Problem Path Builder****

### **Game Format**: **Story Path Vote**

****Format Justification**:** This format allows students to experience the four-step problem-solving process as an unfolding journey where they make sequential decisions at critical choice points. Unlike static instruction, the story path structure demonstrates that problem-solving is a dynamic process where each step builds on the previous one and leads to observable outcomes. Students vote at each decision node (Stop and Notice → Think of Options → Choose One → Try It Out), experiencing how following the systematic process leads to resolution while skipping steps or choosing poorly leads to continued problems. This interactive narrative approach makes the abstract four-step model concrete and memorable by embedding it in a character's journey, showing causality between systematic thinking and successful outcomes. The format reinforces psychology as science by treating problem-solving as a testable process with predictable patterns-when you follow the steps, you get better results.

### **Purpose**: Students navigate a character through a problem-solving journey by voting on which step to use next, experiencing how the four-step model provides structure and reduces overwhelm. This reinforces that systematic problem-solving is more effective than random reactions

### **Placement in Lesson Arc**: Practice C (minutes 31-37). AFTER Practice B (MindMaster Quiz on identifying the four steps). **BEFORE:** Reflection

****Pedagogical Rationale**:** By minute 31, students have seen the four-step model introduced (minutes 5-10), practiced through role-play with peers (minutes 10-20), and taken a knowledge check quiz confirming they can identify and name the steps (minutes 20-26). The game serves as experiential application and integration-students move from "knowing the steps" to "using the steps" in context. The story path format provides scaffolded practice where students experience the full process interactively, seeing how each step connects to the next. The 6-minute duration provides enough time for one complete problem-solving journey with meaningful decision points, positioning this as the capstone practice activity before reflection that consolidates all prior learning.

### Setup

**Opening Screen:**

- Background: Colorful playground scene with multiple activity areas visible
- Main character: "Jamie" (gender-neutral child avatar, friendly cartoon style)
- Text bubble: "Hi! I'm Jamie. I have a problem today and I need your help to solve it using the four problem-solving steps!"
- Display the four steps at top of screen as reference:
  - 🛑 Stop and Notice
  - 💭 Think of Options
  - ✓ Choose One
  - 🎯 Try It Out
- Button 5 (center): "Help Jamie!"

**First Interaction:**  
Student clicks Button 5 to begin the story.

### Play

**Story Structure:** One continuous narrative with 4 decision points (one per problem-solving step)  
Total of 6 story segments with branching outcomes

**STORY SEGMENT 1: The Problem Appears**

**Scene:** Jamie is at the playground. Two friends, Alex and Sam, are both asking Jamie to play.

- Alex (left): "Jamie, come play tag with me!"
- Sam (right): "No, Jamie, play on the swings with me!"
- Jamie (center): "Oh no! They both want to play with me at the same time. What do I do?"

**Narration:** "Jamie has a problem. What should Jamie do FIRST?"

**Decision Point 1: Which step comes first?**

- Button 1: "🛑 Stop and Notice" ✓ CORRECT PATH
- Button 5: "💭 Think of Options"
- Button 9: "🎯 Try It Out"

**Branching:**

**If Button 1 (CORRECT):**  
→ Proceed to Segment 2A (Correct Path)

**If Button 5 or 9 (INCORRECT):**  
→ Proceed to Segment 2B (Incorrect Path - Shows consequence)

**STORY SEGMENT 2A: Correct Path - Stop and Notice**

**Scene:** Jamie pauses, takes a breath, and thinks clearly.

- Jamie: "Let me stop and notice what's happening. The problem is: Two friends want to play with me at the same time, but I can only be in one place."
- Visual: Thought bubble above Jamie showing the problem clearly stated

**Narration:** "Good choice! Jamie stopped and noticed the problem clearly. Now what?"

**Decision Point 2: What comes next?**

- Button 1: "🛑 Stop and Notice again"
- Button 5: "💭 Think of Options" ✓ CORRECT
- Button 9: "🎯 Try It Out"

→ Proceed to Segment 3A (if Button 5) or Segment 3B (if wrong choice)

**STORY SEGMENT 2B: Incorrect Path - Skipping Stop and Notice**

**Scene:** Jamie immediately runs toward Alex without thinking.

- Sam (upset): "Hey! You didn't even think about it!"
- Alex (confused): "Wait, but you look worried..."
- Jamie (stressed): "I don't know what to do! This feels confusing!"

**Narration:** "Uh oh. When we skip 'Stop and Notice,' we don't understand the problem clearly. Let's help Jamie try again."

**Recovery Decision:**

- Button 5: "Go back and Stop and Notice first" → Returns to Segment 2A

**STORY SEGMENT 3A: Correct Path - Think of Options**

**Scene:** Jamie's Idea Factory activates (visual: lightbulb, thought bubbles with different ideas)

- Jamie: "Let me think of OPTIONS. I could:"
  - Option 1: "Play tag first, then swings"
  - Option 2: "Ask both to play together"
  - Option 3: "Take turns-tag today, swings tomorrow"

**Narration:** "Jamie's Idea Factory is working! Jamie thought of THREE different options. What should Jamie do next?"

**Decision Point 3: What's the next step?**

- Button 1: "🛑 Stop and Notice"
- Button 5: "✓ Choose One" ✓ CORRECT
- Button 9: "💭 Think of more options"

→ Proceed to Segment 4A (if Button 5) or Segment 4B (if wrong choice)

**STORY SEGMENT 3B: Incorrect Path - Trying without options**

**Scene:** Jamie runs to Alex without thinking of other choices.

- Jamie (to Alex): "Let's play tag!"
- Sam (hurt): "You didn't even think about me..."
- Jamie (realizes): "Oh no, I forgot to think of different ways to solve this!"

**Narration:** "When we don't think of options, we might pick too quickly and miss better solutions. Let's help Jamie try again."

**Recovery Decision:**

- Button 5: "Go back and Think of Options" → Returns to Segment 3A

**STORY SEGMENT 4A: Correct Path - Choose One**

**Scene:** Jamie looks at the three options and decides.

- Jamie: "I'm going to CHOOSE option 2: Ask both friends to play TOGETHER. Maybe we can combine tag and swings into one game!"

**Narration:** "Jamie chose the option that seemed best for this situation. Now what's the LAST step?"

**Decision Point 4: What's the final step?**

- Button 1: "💭 Think of Options again"
- Button 5: "🎯 Try It Out" ✓ CORRECT
- Button 9: "🛑 Stop and Notice"

→ Proceed to Segment 5A (if Button 5) or Segment 5B (if wrong choice)

**STORY SEGMENT 4B: Incorrect Path - Not choosing**

**Scene:** Jamie stands frozen, looking at the options but not deciding.

- Alex: "Jamie, are you coming?"
- Sam: "What are you going to do?"
- Jamie (anxious): "I can't decide! All the options seem okay!"

**Narration:** "When we don't choose one option to try, we stay stuck. Let's help Jamie pick one."

**Recovery Decision:**

- Button 5: "Go back and Choose One option" → Returns to Segment 4A

**STORY SEGMENT 5A: Correct Path - Try It Out (SUCCESS)**

**Scene:** Jamie walks to both friends with confidence.

- Jamie: "Hey! Want to play 'Tag and Swing'? We chase each other, but we have to tag from the swings!"
- Alex: "That sounds fun!"
- Sam: "Yeah! Let's try it!"
- All three run to the swings, smiling

**Narration:** "Jamie TRIED IT OUT! And it worked! Both friends are happy, and Jamie solved the problem by following all four steps."

**Visual:** The four steps appear in sequence with checkmarks:

- ✓ 🛑 Stop and Notice
- ✓ 💭 Think of Options
- ✓ ✓ Choose One
- ✓ 🎯 Try It Out

**Final Message:**  
"You helped Jamie solve the problem! Notice how using all four steps made Jamie feel less worried and more confident. That's the power of having a process!"

→ Proceed to Success Screen

**STORY SEGMENT 5B: Incorrect Path - Not trying**

**Scene:** Jamie stands still, doesn't act on the choice.

- Jamie: "I chose an idea but... I didn't do it yet."
- Alex and Sam walk away looking disappointed
- Jamie (sad): "I had a good idea but I needed to TRY IT OUT."

**Narration:** "The last step is important! We have to try our choice to see if it works. Let's help Jamie try it out."

**Recovery Decision:**

- Button 5: "Go back and Try It Out" → Returns to Segment 5A

### Scoring

## In-Class-Game 8C – The Brain Gym

## Lesson 3: Thinking of Different Solutions

## LESSON LINK & LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Students will understand that most problems do not have only one "right" answer-there are usually many possible solutions. They will practice generating at least three different solutions to a single problem and comparing them to choose the best fit for the specific situation. They will recognize that creativity, flexibility, and trying new ideas are strengths, not weaknesses, in problem-solving.

## Game file name: icg-08.03-game01.html

## **Game title: The Brain Gym**

## Game format: **Cognitive Challenge Mini-Game (Timed Challenge with generative thinking)**

This format is justified because it emphasizes speed and quantity of idea generation, which directly reinforces flexible thinking-the core skill of Lesson 3. The gym/training metaphor frames the brain's ability to generate multiple solutions as a mental muscle that can be exercised and strengthened. The timed element adds engagement while the multiple-round structure allows students to practice flexibility across different problem types, demonstrating that this cognitive skill generalizes across contexts.

## Purpose: Students practice generating multiple different solutions to various problems within time limits, then compare solutions to determine which fits best. This builds cognitive flexibility, creative thinking, and the understanding that problems typically have many valid approaches-not just one correct answer

**Placement in Lesson**: Practice C (minutes 28-35). AFTER Practice B (Comparing Solutions). Practice C (MindMaster Game). BEFORE Reflection.

**Pedagogical Reasoning:**

- Students first watch creativity video and engage in group brainstorming (minutes 8-20: collaborative idea generation)
- Then practice comparing solutions for "best fit" (minutes 20-28: evaluative thinking)
- Game serves as: Skill intensification and individual mastery check
- By minute 28, students understand that multiple solutions exist and have practiced generating them collaboratively
- Game provides individual practice at speed, building fluency with flexible thinking
- Timed format adds challenge after scaffolded group work
- 7-minute duration allows for 6 training stations with varied mechanics
- Placement allows students to demonstrate independent flexible thinking competency before reflection

## SETUP

**Opening Screen:**

- Title: "Brain Gym: Flex Your Thinking!"
- Same detective avatar from Lessons 1-2, now wearing athletic headband and holding a whistle
- Detective says: "Welcome to Brain Gym! Your Idea Factory is like a muscle-the more you use it, the stronger it gets. Today we're training your brain to think of LOTS of different solutions!"
- Visual: Cartoon gym setting with three training stations displayed:
  - Station 1: "Speed Round" (lightning bolt icon)
  - Station 2: "Variety Challenge" (rainbow icon)
  - Station 3: "Best Fit Test" (target icon)
- Center: Large "Idea Counter" showing 0 ideas generated
- Bottom UI: "Training Rounds Completed: 0/6" | "Flexibility Score: 0"
- Top-right: "Brain Power Meter" (empty bar that fills as student progresses)
- "Return to Lesson" link in top-left corner

**Instructions appear in speech bubble:** "You'll see a problem and have a short time to think of different solutions. More ideas = stronger brain! Use Buttons 1-9 to pick your answers. Let's warm up!"

**Warm-Up Round (Tutorial):** Before main game, one practice problem appears:

- "Your pencil breaks during writing time. What could you do?"
- Four solutions displayed with buttons:
  - Button 1 = "Sharpen it"
  - Button 2 = "Use a pen instead"
  - Button 3 = "Ask to borrow one"
  - Button 4 = "Use a crayon"
- Detective says: "Press ALL the buttons that show good solutions! That's flexible thinking!"
- Student presses multiple buttons (any of 1-4)
- Feedback: "You thought of \[X\] solutions! Scientists call this 'generative thinking.' Now let's train for real!"

## PLAY

**PHASE 1: SPEED ROUND (Stations 1-2)**

Game presents 2 problems in "speed round" format. Goal: Generate as many solutions as possible quickly.

**Speed Round Problem Examples:**

- **Problem 1:** "Two friends want to sit in the same special chair at reading time."
- **Problem 2:** "You want to build a tall tower but keep running out of blocks."

**For each Speed Round problem:**

- **Problem Introduction (5 seconds)**
  - Problem appears on screen with cartoon illustration
  - Detective: "Problem alert! How many solutions can your Idea Factory imagine?"
  - Timer appears: "30 seconds to think!"
- **Solution Generation Phase (30 seconds)**
  - Six solution options appear on screen, each assigned to Buttons 1-6:
    - 4 valid solutions (varied approaches)
    - 1 creative/unusual but valid solution
    - 1 invalid/unhelpful solution

**Example for Problem 1 (special chair):**

- 1. Button 1 = "Take turns-one sits first, then the other" ✓
  - Button 2 = "Both stand and use the table instead" ✓
  - Button 3 = "Find a second special chair or cushion" ✓
  - Button 4 = "Sit together if the chair is big enough" ✓ (creative)
  - Button 5 = "Play rock-paper-scissors to decide" ✓
  - Button 6 = "Push the other friend away" ✗
  - Timer counts down from 30 seconds (displayed prominently)
  - Detective: "Press buttons for solutions that could work! Go fast!"
  - Student rapidly presses buttons 1-6 to select solutions
  - Each valid button pressed: Visual checkmark appears + "+1 Idea!" pops up
  - Each invalid button pressed: Visual X appears + "Oops, that wouldn't help"
  - Student can press multiple buttons (multi-select enabled)

- **Round Summary (5 seconds)**
  - Timer stops
  - Screen shows: "Speed Round Complete!"
  - "Ideas Generated: \[X\]/5 valid solutions"
  - Idea Counter updates (e.g., "Total Ideas: 8")
  - If student selected 4+ valid solutions: "Excellent flexible thinking! Your Idea Factory is warming up!"
  - If student selected 2-3 valid solutions: "Good work! The more you practice, the more ideas you'll generate."
  - If student selected 0-1 valid solutions: "Let's keep training. Remember: flexible thinkers imagine lots of options!"

**PHASE 2: VARIETY CHALLENGE (Stations 3-4)**

Game presents 2 problems in "variety challenge" format. Goal: Select solutions from DIFFERENT categories to demonstrate varied thinking.

**Variety Challenge Problem Examples:**

- **Problem 3:** "You're playing a game but your friend wants to change the rules."
- **Problem 4:** "The art supplies you need are all being used by other students."

**For each Variety Challenge problem:**

- **Problem Introduction (5 seconds)**
  - Problem appears with illustration
  - Detective: "Variety Challenge! Scientists look for DIFFERENT TYPES of solutions. Can you find three different approaches?"
- **Solution Selection with Categories (45 seconds)**
  - Six solutions appear, each labeled with a category icon:
    - 2 "Compromise" solutions (handshake icon)
    - 2 "Alternative" solutions (lightbulb icon)
    - 2 "Ask for Help" solutions (helping hand icon)

**Example for Problem 3 (game rules):**

- - Button 1 = "Try the new rules for one round, then decide" (Compromise) ✓
    - Button 2 = "Play half the game their way, half your way" (Compromise) ✓
    - Button 3 = "Play a completely different game you both like" (Alternative) ✓
    - Button 4 = "Make up new rules together" (Alternative) ✓
    - Button 5 = "Ask another friend what they think" (Ask for Help) ✓
    - Button 6 = "Ask a teacher to help decide" (Ask for Help) ✓
    - Task instruction appears: "Pick 3 solutions from DIFFERENT categories!"
    - Student presses buttons 1-6
    - Visual feedback shows which categories selected (icons light up)
    - If student picks 3 from different categories: "+5 Variety Bonus!"
    - If student picks 3 from only 1-2 categories: "Try picking from different categories to show flexible thinking!"
- **Variety Assessment (5 seconds)**
  - Screen shows selected solutions with category labels highlighted
  - "Categories Used: \[X\]/3"
  - If 3 different categories: "You showed varied thinking! Your Idea Factory explored different types of solutions!"
  - If 2 categories: "You found different ideas. Next time, try exploring even more types!"
  - Idea Counter updates

**PHASE 3: BEST FIT TEST (Stations 5-6)**

Game presents 2 problems in "best fit" format. Goal: Generate multiple solutions, then analyze which fits the specific situation best.

**Best Fit Problem Examples:**

- **Problem 5:** "Your little brother accidentally broke your favorite toy."
- **Problem 6:** "You finished your lunch but your friend is still eating and you want to play."

**For each Best Fit problem:**

- **Problem Introduction + Context (5 seconds)**
  - Problem appears with additional context information
  - Detective: "Best Fit Test! Scientists don't just think of solutions-they figure out which one FITS the situation best!"

**Example for Problem 5:**

- - Context shown: "Your brother feels really sorry. He didn't mean to break it. He's only 3 years old."
- **Generate Solutions Phase (30 seconds)**
  - Four solutions appear (Buttons 1-4), all valid but varying in appropriateness
  - Detective: "All of these could work, but which fits THIS situation best? Think about the context!"

**Example for Problem 5 (broken toy, little brother):**

- - Button 1 = "Yell at him that he's bad"
    - Button 2 = "Tell him it's okay, accidents happen"
    - Button 3 = "Ask parent to help fix it together"
    - Button 4 = "Say he can never play with your toys again"
    - Student first presses ALL solutions they think could work (multi-select, 15 seconds)
    - Detective: "You found \[X\] possible solutions. Now which is BEST for this situation?"
- **Best Fit Selection Phase (15 seconds)**
  - Same four solutions remain visible
  - New instruction: "Now pick the ONE that fits best!"
  - Student presses one button (1-4)
  - Buttons show "fit rating" visual:
    - Best fit (given context): Green checkmark with "Perfect fit! You considered the context!"
    - Acceptable fit: Yellow checkmark with "That could work. Scientists say the best fit is \[answer\] because \[reason\]."
    - Poor fit (given context): Orange X with "That wouldn't fit this situation well. Remember: \[context detail\]."
- **Reasoning Display (5 seconds)**
  - Screen shows: "Why \[best answer\] fits: \[brief explanation connecting to context\]"
  - Example: "Why 'tell him it's okay' fits: Your brother is very young and feels sorry. Being kind helps him learn. Your Messenger notices his feelings, your Idea Factory thinks about what helps, and your Action Player chooses kindness."
  - Idea Counter updates
  - Flexibility Score increases based on number of solutions generated + correct best fit selection

## WIN CONDITION

Student completes the game when all 6 training stations (problems) have been completed across the three challenge types.

**Completion Screen:**

- Detective avatar (in athletic gear) celebrates with flexed arms: "Brain Gym complete! You trained your Idea Factory!"
- Summary display:
  - "Training Stations Completed: 6/6 ✓"
  - "Total Ideas Generated: \[X\]"
  - "Flexibility Score: \[X\]/100"
  - "Total Points: \[score\]"
  - "Brain Power Level: ⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡" (5 lightning bolts based on score)

  - "Speed Thinker" badge (for completing speed rounds quickly)
  - "Variety Master" badge (for using different solution categories)
  - "Context Expert" badge (for selecting best-fit solutions)
- Key science message: "You discovered that your brain can generate many different solutions! Flexible thinking-imagining multiple options-is a mental skill. Every time you practiced, your Idea Factory got stronger. Scientists have found that people who think flexibly solve problems better. You also learned that the BEST solution depends on the situation-context matters! Now you can use flexible thinking anywhere!"
- Visual comparison shown:
  - "Before Training: \[X\] ideas in 30 seconds"
  - "After Training: \[Y\] ideas in 30 seconds"
  - "Growth: \[Y-X\] more ideas! Your brain got stronger!"
- Two buttons appear:
  - Button 5 = "Train Again" (resets game)
  - Button 9 = "Return to Lesson"

## CONTINUITY NOTE

This game deepens the four-step model from Lesson 2 by focusing specifically on Step 2 (Think of Options). The detective avatar continues from Lessons 1-2 but now appears as a "trainer," reinforcing that cognitive skills can be practiced and improved. The gym metaphor normalizes that flexible thinking is a trainable ability, not an innate trait.

The three-station structure (Speed, Variety, Best Fit) scaffolds increasingly complex aspects of flexible thinking: first generating quantity, then generating diversity, then evaluating fit-mirroring the scientific process of hypothesis generation and evaluation.

This prepares students for Lesson 4, where they'll learn that when their chosen solution doesn't work, they can return to their "idea bank" (generated through flexible thinking) to try a different option-making persistence practical rather than abstract.

The same detective avatar will appear in Lesson 4 to complete the unit arc.

## In-Class-Game 8D – Puzzle Mountain Expedition

**Lesson 4: Keep Trying and Ask for Help**

### Lesson Link & Learning Objective

Students will learn that problem-solving is rarely perfect the first time and that when a chosen solution doesn't work, persistence-trying again with a different approach-is the appropriate response. They will understand that asking for help is a smart strategy and a sign of strength, not weakness.

### Game File Name: icg-08.04-game01.html

### **Game Title: **Puzzle Mountain Expedition****

### **Game Format**: **Treasure Expedition**

****Format Justification**:** This format allows students to experience persistence and help-seeking through sequential challenge unlocking, where progression requires overcoming obstacles that cannot be solved on the first attempt. Unlike static instruction about persistence, the expedition structure creates authentic struggle moments where initial strategies fail, requiring students to either adjust their approach (persistence) or accept assistance from guide characters (help-seeking) to advance. Each location presents a problem that deliberately resists easy solution, mirroring real problem-solving where first attempts often fail. The unlocking mechanic demonstrates causally that persistence and help-seeking enable progress-students cannot advance without using these strategies, making abstract concepts (try again, ask for help) into concrete, necessary actions with observable results. This experiential format treats persistence as a scientific variable: students test different approaches, observe outcomes, and discover through repeated trials that adjustment and collaboration are effective problem-solving mechanisms, not failures.

### **Purpose**: Students navigate through multiple challenge zones where initial problem-solving attempts fail, requiring them to persist with adjusted strategies or request help from guide characters. This creates experiential understanding that persistence and help-seeking are effective, normal strategies that enable success

### **Placement in Lesson Arc**: Explore A + Practice A (minutes 5-11). AFTER Warm-Up. **BEFORE:** Practice A (Role-Play with Adjustments)

****Pedagogical Rationale**:** The game appears EARLY in the lesson (minutes 5-11) as the foundational experiential learning vehicle. This is intentional-students need to experience failure and persistence before discussing it abstractly. The game serves as the primary data-generation tool: it creates the phenomena (struggling, trying again, seeking help, succeeding) that the lesson then analyzes and names. Following the game (minutes 11-21), students engage in role-plays that reference game experiences: "Remember when you tried the puzzle and it didn't work the first time? That's what this character is experiencing." The quiz (minutes 27-33) and workshop (minutes 33-41) build on insights from game experience. This pedagogical sequence (experience → name → practice → reflect) reflects discovery-based learning where the game generates authentic struggle that becomes the object of study, making persistence and help-seeking concrete before conceptualizing them.

### Setup

**Opening Screen:**

- Background: Base of a colorful mountain with three visible challenge zones ascending upward
- Main character: "Scout" (friendly explorer avatar, backpack, map)
- Helper characters visible at different zones: "Guide Kai" (experienced climber), "Engineer Maya" (tool expert), "Navigator Sam" (path finder)
- Text from Scout: "Welcome, explorer! I need to reach the summit, but there are puzzles blocking the path. Some are tricky-I might need to try different ways or ask for help!"
- Mountain zones labeled:
  - Zone 1: "Boulder Bridge" (bottom)
  - Zone 2: "Pattern Path" (middle)
  - Zone 3: "Summit Gate" (top)
- Button 5 (center): "Start Climbing"

**First Interaction:**  
Student clicks Button 5 to begin Zone 1.

### Play

**Game Structure:** 3 challenge zones, each requiring multiple attempts or help-seeking  
Each zone follows: Attempt 1 (fails) → Decision Point → Attempt 2 or Help → Success → Next Zone

**ZONE 1: Boulder Bridge**

**Challenge Setup:**

- Scene: Path blocked by large boulders arranged in a pattern
- Scout: "I need to move these boulders to make a bridge. Let me try!"
- Puzzle displayed: 4 boulders with symbols (circle, square, triangle, star)
- Task: "Which boulder should I move first?"

**ATTEMPT 1 (Designed to fail for most students):**

- Display 4 options (buttons 1, 3, 7, 9 showing the symbols)
- Student selects one
- Result: "The boulder is too heavy! It barely moved. That didn't work."
- Scout (frustrated): "Hmm, my first idea didn't work. What should I do now?"

**DECISION POINT 1: Persist or Ask for Help?**

- Button 1: "Try a DIFFERENT boulder" (persistence path)
- Button 9: "Ask Guide Kai for HELP" (help-seeking path)

**PERSISTENCE PATH:**

- If Button 1: Scout tries again with adjusted strategy
- Display different boulder arrangement
- Student selects again (buttons 1, 3, 7, 9)
- Correct answer reveals: Triangle boulder moves first, creating part of bridge
- Feedback: "You tried again with a different approach! That's persistence."
- **Key teaching moment:** "Notice: Your Messenger felt frustrated (that's information!), your Idea Factory thought 'try differently,' and your Action Player did it-which made your Messenger feel proud. See the loop?"

**HELP-SEEKING PATH:**

- If Button 9: Guide Kai appears
- Kai: "Good thinking asking for help! Here's a hint: Look for the lightest boulder-it has three sides."
- Student applies hint (buttons showing boulders)
- Correct answer reveals: Triangle boulder moves, creating bridge
- Feedback: "You asked for help and used the information. That's smart problem-solving!"
- **Key teaching moment:** "Asking for help isn't weakness-it's another tool in your problem-solving toolkit."

**ZONE 1 COMPLETION:**

- Bridge completes with satisfying animation
- Scout crosses to Zone 2
- Progress indicator: "Zone 1 Complete! ⭐"

**ZONE 2: Pattern Path**

**Challenge Setup:**

- Scene: Stepping stones with patterns, but some stones are missing
- Scout: "I need to figure out which stones are safe to step on. Let me look at the pattern..."
- Pattern displayed: Red, Blue, Red, Blue, \[?\], \[?\]
- Task: "What comes next in the pattern?"

**ATTEMPT 1 (Designed to be difficult):**

- Display 4 color options (buttons 1, 3, 7, 9: Red, Blue, Green, Yellow)
- Student selects
- If wrong: Scout steps, stone wobbles, Scout jumps back
- Result: "Oh no! That stone wasn't safe. My first try didn't work."
- Scout (thinking): "The pattern is trickier than I thought. What should I do?"

**DECISION POINT 2: Persist or Ask for Help?**

- Button 1: "Look at the pattern AGAIN" (persistence path)
- Button 9: "Ask Engineer Maya for HELP" (help-seeking path)

**PERSISTENCE PATH:**

- If Button 1: Scout examines pattern more carefully
- Display pattern with more context: Red, Blue, Red, Blue, \[?\], \[?\], Red, Blue
- Student selects again
- Correct answer (Red): Stone glows green, safe to step
- Feedback: "You looked more carefully and figured it out! Persistence helps you see details you missed."
- **Key teaching moment:** "When something is hard, looking again with fresh eyes is a smart adjustment."

**HELP-SEEKING PATH:**

- If Button 9: Engineer Maya appears
- Maya: "Want help? The pattern repeats every two stones. After Blue comes..."
- Student applies hint (buttons 1, 3, 7, 9 showing colors)
- Correct answer (Red): Stone glows, safe to step
- Feedback: "You listened to Maya's advice and solved it! That's collaboration."
- **Key teaching moment:** "Engineers and scientists ask colleagues for help all the time-it makes everyone smarter."

**ZONE 2 COMPLETION:**

- Path completes, Scout walks across safely
- Progress indicator: "Zone 2 Complete! ⭐⭐"

**ZONE 3: Summit Gate**

**Challenge Setup:**

- Scene: Large gate with combination lock (three dials)
- Scout: "This is the hardest puzzle yet! The gate needs the right combination to open."
- Lock displayed: Three dials, each showing numbers 1-9
- Task: "What combination opens the gate?"

**ATTEMPT 1 (Intentionally very difficult):**

- Display number pad (buttons 1-9)
- Student tries to enter three numbers
- Result: Gate stays locked, red light flashes
- Scout (worried): "That didn't work. This one is really tough. I've tried twice on this mountain and some things are still hard."

**DECISION POINT 3: Persist or Ask for Help?**

- Button 1: "Try ONE more combination" (persistence path)
- Button 5: "Ask BOTH helpers together" (collaborative help-seeking)
- Button 9: "Ask Navigator Sam for HELP" (help-seeking path)

**PERSISTENCE PATH (Still difficult):**

- If Button 1: Scout tries one more time alone
- Student selects three numbers
- If wrong: "It's still locked. Sometimes problems are too big to solve alone."
- **Redirect:** "Maybe asking for help is the smart choice here?"
- Automatically prompts: "Ask Navigator Sam?" → Button 5: "Yes"
- **Key teaching moment:** "You tried hard! And then you recognized when to ask for help. That's excellent problem-solving."

**HELP-SEEKING PATH:**

- If Button 9: Navigator Sam appears
- Sam: "This is a tough one! Here's what I noticed: The first number matches how many zones you climbed (3). The second is how many helpers you met (3). The third is how many times you kept trying (varies, but accept any)."
- Student enters 3-3-\[their choice\]
- Gate opens with satisfying sound
- Feedback: "You asked for help when the problem was really hard. That's wisdom!"

**COLLABORATIVE PATH:**

- If Button 5: All three helpers gather
- Kai, Maya, and Sam together: "We can solve this as a team! Each of us has one number..."
- Kai: "First dial: 3" / Maya: "Second dial: 3" / Sam: "Third dial: You choose what feels right!"
- Student selects third number (any button 1-9 accepted)
- Gate opens
- Feedback: "You used teamwork! When problems are big, asking multiple people is super smart."
- **Key teaching moment:** "The hardest problems often need collaboration. Scientists work in teams for this reason!"

**ZONE 3 COMPLETION:**

- Gate swings open
- Scout reaches summit, plants flag
- All helpers cheer from below

### Scoring

**Point System:**

- **Complete Zone 1:** 3 points (regardless of persistence vs. help path)
- **Complete Zone 2:** 3 points (regardless of path chosen)
- **Complete Zone 3:** 4 points (bonus for reaching summit)
- **Persistence bonus:** +1 point each time student chooses "try again" path
- **Help-seeking bonus:** +1 point each time student chooses "ask for help" path
- **Total possible:** 10-16 points (depending on path choices)

**Progress Tracking:**

- Mountain visual shows Scout's position ascending
- Stars earned: ⭐ for each zone completed
- Both persistence and help-seeking paths earn equal points-emphasizing that both are valuable strategies

**Key Scoring Philosophy:**

- No penalties for "failing" first attempts (designed into game)
- Equal value for persistence and help-seeking (both earn bonuses)
- Completion is success-reinforces that reaching goals matters, not perfection

### Win Condition

**Completion:**

- Student guides Scout through all three zones to summit
- Requires experiencing at least one failed attempt in each zone
- Must make at least 3 persistence/help-seeking decisions

**Success Screen:**

- Scene: Scout at summit with mountain view, all three helpers visible below waving
- Scout: "We made it! I couldn't have done it without trying again when things didn't work AND asking for help when I needed it."
- Display shows student's path:
  - "Times you tried again: \[X\]"
  - "Times you asked for help: \[Y\]"
  - "Zones completed: 3/3 ⭐⭐⭐"
- Key message: "You discovered two powerful problem-solving tools: PERSISTENCE (trying different ways) and HELP-SEEKING (asking others). Both are smart strategies!"
- Display score: "You earned \[X\] points!"

**Reflection Prompt (built into success screen):**

- "Which helped more on this expedition: trying again, or asking for help?"
- Buttons 1, 5, 9: "Trying again" / "Both equally" / "Asking for help"
- After vote: "Great thinking! Actually, BOTH are important. Sometimes we persist, sometimes we ask for help, and sometimes we do both. Scientists use both strategies every day."

**Button Options:**

- Button 5: "Return to Class" → links to lesson-08.04.html
- Button 7: "Climb Again" → restart game (students can try different paths)

### Continuity Note

**Link to Prior Learning:**  
Builds directly on Lessons 1-3: Students now know problems are normal (L1), have a four-step process (L2), and can think of multiple solutions (L3). This lesson adds the reality that solutions don't always work the first time, requiring persistence and help-seeking.

**Link to Unit 1:**  
Explicitly references the three parts of the mind and their reciprocal loops: Messenger provides information (frustration), Idea Factory generates adjusted strategies, Action Player tries new approaches, and the loop continues as actions create new feelings and thoughts. Reinforces that the Action Player's choices (trying again, asking for help) influence what the Messenger feels (pride, confidence) and what the Idea Factory thinks ("I can handle this").

**Link to Future Learning (Unit 9):**  
Prepares students for examining how their actions create effects. The game demonstrates that the action of persisting or help-seeking creates the effect of progress-a cause-and-effect relationship that will be explored systematically in Unit 9.

### Estimated Play Time

**6-7 minutes**

- Zone 1: 2 minutes (attempt, decision, resolution)
- Zone 2: 2 minutes (attempt, decision, resolution)
- Zone 3: 2-2.5 minutes (attempt, decision, resolution, more complex)
- Opening/success screens: 30-60 seconds
