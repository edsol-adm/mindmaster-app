## Home Game 3A – Solution Factory: Build Multiple Pathways
> Jump to: [Setup](#setup) · [Play](#play) · [Scoring](#scoring) · [Win Condition](#win-condition) · [Continuity Note](#continuity-note)

### Learning Objective
Students explain that most problems have multiple possible solutions. They generate at least three different solutions through brainstorming and demonstrate flexible thinking by remaining open to different approaches.

### Game File Name & Format
`hg-08.03-01.html` — Match-3 Puzzle (adapted for solution generation)

### Game Title
**"Solution Factory: Build Multiple Pathways"**

### Game Purpose
Reinforce that generating multiple solutions requires flexible thinking and pattern recognition. Players learn that solution types can combine in different ways, just like puzzle pieces, and that variety strengthens problem-solving.

### Estimated Play Time
9–12 minutes (1.5–2 minutes per level × 6 levels)

---

### Setup
**Opening Screen:**
- Title: "Solution Factory: Build Multiple Pathways"
- Background: Bright factory setting with conveyor belts and solution-building machines
- Character introduction: Meet Factory Chief Finn (cartoon child wearing factory uniform and hard hat)
- Instructions: "Welcome to the Solution Factory! Every problem needs MANY solutions, not just one. Match solution blocks to build different pathways. The more pathways you build, the stronger your problem-solving becomes!"
- Three Solution Types displayed (colour-coded):
  - 🔵 Practical Solutions (blue blocks) — "Straightforward, tried-and-true ideas"
  - 🟣 Creative Solutions (purple blocks) — "Imaginative, unusual ideas"
  - 🟢 Help-Seeking Solutions (green blocks) — "Ask others for ideas or support"
- Button: "Enter Factory" → begins tutorial

**Tutorial (30 seconds):**
- Factory Chief Finn demonstrates:  
  "See these solution blocks? When you match 3 or more of the SAME type in a row, you build a solution pathway!"
- Shows example: Three blue Practical blocks in a row disappear, creating a "pathway" that fills part of a progress bar  
- "But notice: we need ALL THREE types to solve problems well. Match all the colours!"  
- Simple practice round: Player matches a few blocks  
- "Great! Now let's solve real problems by building pathways!"  
- Button: "Start Building!" → begins Level 1

**UI Elements:**
- Game Board (centre): 6×6 grid filled with coloured solution blocks (🔵🟣🟢)
- Problem Display (top): Shows current problem being solved
- Pathway Progress (left side): Three progress bars (one per solution type—Practical, Creative, Help-Seeking)

### Play
**Gameplay Loop (6 levels, each representing a different problem):**

**Level Structure:**
- **Problem Introduction:**  
  Factory Chief Finn presents a problem.  
  Examples of 6 problems:
  1. "You want to join a game, but the group seems full."
  2. "You're working on a puzzle, but a piece doesn't fit."
  3. "Your friend is upset, and you don't know why."
  4. "You have homework to do, but you also want to play."
  5. "Your art project isn't turning out how you imagined."
  6. "Two classmates are arguing and asking you to pick sides."

- **Game Board Setup:**  
  6×6 grid populates with random solution blocks (mix of 🔵🟣🟢)  
  Each block has a simple icon representing a solution idea:  
  - Blue Practical: clipboard, checklist, schedule icons  
  - Purple Creative: lightbulb, sparkle, imagination cloud icons  
  - Green Help-Seeking: handshake, speech bubble, question mark icons  

- **Matching Mechanic:**  
  - Task: Player swaps adjacent blocks to create matches of 3 or more in a row (horizontal or vertical)  
  - 3+ blocks of same colour match → blocks disappear with satisfying pop  
  - New blocks fall from top to fill gaps (like Candy Crush)  
  - Each match fills that solution type’s progress bar  
  - 3-block match = 1 segment; 4-block = 2 segments; 5+ = 3 segments + bonus points  
  - Goal: Fill ALL THREE pathway progress bars to complete the level  
  - Moves limit: 20–25 moves per level  

- **Special Blocks (appear randomly):**  
  🌈 Rainbow Solution Block – matches with any colour (flexible thinking)  
  ✨ Combo Block – clears entire row or column  
  💡 Bonus Idea Block – adds +5 bonus points  

- **Scientific Frame Reinforcement:**  
  When a progress bar fills, Factory Chief Finn comments:  
  - Practical complete: "Great! You've built practical solutions!"  
  - Creative complete: "Excellent! Creative thinking helps us see new ways!"  
  - Help-Seeking complete: "Smart! Asking for help shows strength!"  
  When all three filled: "Perfect! This problem now has MANY solutions—practical, creative, AND help-seeking. That's flexible thinking!"

- **Level Completion:**  
  All three pathways filled → Level Complete!  
  Scoring:  
  - ⭐⭐⭐ All three pathways filled with moves remaining  
  - ⭐⭐ All three filled, few moves left  
  - ⭐ All three filled, barely made it  
  - Bonus: +50 points per unused move; +100 per Combo Block; +200 if bars filled evenly  
  - Factory Chief Finn: "Problem solved with MULTIPLE solutions! Let's build more!"  
  - Button: "Next Level" → loads next problem

- **Failure Condition (gentle):**  
  If player runs out of moves:  
  "Almost! You built [X] of 3 pathways. Let's try again—remember to match ALL the colours!"  
  Option to retry level (no penalty).

### Continuity Note
This game uses a familiar Match-3 mechanic but reimagines it to teach multiple-solution thinking. By requiring players to build all three solution types—practical, creative, help-seeking—it reinforces that flexible problem-solving means generating diverse options, not just the first idea that comes to mind. This prepares players for Lesson 4, where they’ll learn that when one solution doesn’t work, having generated multiple options means they have alternatives to try—demonstrating persistence.

### Continuity Note
This game emphasizes the speed and quantity aspect of brainstorming—teaching players that generating MANY solutions quickly is a valuable skill. Unlike Game 3A (Solution Factory) which focused on matching solution types thoughtfully through a puzzle mechanic, this game rewards rapid idea generation and diversity through timed pressure.

Together, the two Lesson 3 games show:
- Game 3A: Thoughtful categorization and pattern-matching of solution types  
- Game 3B: Fast, prolific idea generation without self-censoring  

This dual approach teaches that flexible thinking involves:
- Quantity (generating many options—this game)  
- Quality (recognizing different solution categories—Game 3A)  

Preparation for Lesson 4: This game directly prepares players for Lesson 4's persistence concepts. Having practiced planting many "seeds" (solution options), players understand that when their first choice doesn't work, they have backup plans—demonstrating persistence through having generated alternatives. The garden metaphor reinforces that problem-solving is about cultivation: planting many seeds increases the chance that some will flourish.

**Scientific Framework:** The game is grounded in creativity research showing that:
- Divergent thinking (generating multiple ideas) precedes convergent thinking (selecting best option)  
- Quantity often leads to quality in brainstorming  
- Time pressure can enhance creative output by reducing self-censorship  
- Diverse idea types (practical, creative, collaborative) strengthen problem-solving

## How Lesson 3 Fits into the Full Learning Arc

Lesson 3 expands the Unit 8 problem-solving framework by deepening the *Think of Options* stage of the four-step model. Whereas Lesson 2 focused on applying structured steps, Lesson 3 helps children discover that strong problem-solvers use imagination and flexibility to create more than one possible answer. The two home games reinforce this from complementary angles: **Solution Factory** develops deliberate, pattern-based thinking for identifying solution types, while **Idea Sprout** builds fluency and speed in generating diverse ideas. Together they shift children from *following steps* to *thinking creatively within steps.*

- **Lesson 1:** Normalises problems as everyday challenges and introduces the idea that they can be approached using the mind’s tools.  
- **Lesson 2:** Teaches the structured four-step model (Stop → Think → Choose → Try) that turns confusion into action.  
- **Lesson 3 (this document):** Strengthens the *Think of Options* step through flexible, imaginative solution-generation, showing that most problems have more than one right answer.  
- **Lesson 4:** Builds persistence and help-seeking, showing that when one idea doesn’t work, having multiple options allows continued progress.
