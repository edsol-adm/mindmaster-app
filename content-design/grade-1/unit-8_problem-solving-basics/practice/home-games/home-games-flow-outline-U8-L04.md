## Home Game 4A – Persistence Path: The Retry Maze
> Jump to: [Setup](#setup) · [Play](#play) · [Scoring](#scoring) · [Win Condition](#win-condition) · [Continuity Note](#continuity-note)

### Learning Objective
Students explain that solutions don't always work the first time, and persistence means trying again with adjustments. They identify when asking for help is a smart strategy rather than a sign of weakness.

### Game File Name & Format
`hg-08.04-01.html` — Cause & Effect Chains

### Game Purpose
Reinforce that persistence means adjusting strategies when initial attempts fail. Players learn through trial-and-error that failure provides information for better next attempts, teaching resilience and adaptive thinking.

### Estimated Play Time
8–10 minutes (1.5–2 minutes per challenge × 5 challenges)

---

### Setup
**Opening Screen:**
- Title: "Persistence Path: The Retry Maze"
- Background: Winding path through a colorful landscape with checkpoints and obstacles
- Character introduction: Meet Path Walker Penny (cartoon child with backpack, determination expression)
- Instructions: "On this path, you'll face problems. Your first try might not work—and that's OK! When something doesn't work, you'll learn WHY, adjust your plan, and try again. That's persistence!"
- Button: "Start Walking" → begins tutorial

**Tutorial (30 seconds):**
- Path Walker Penny demonstrates with simple example:  
  "I want to cross this stream. I'll try jumping across!"  
  Animation shows Penny jumping → splashing into water (failure)  
  "Oops! That didn't work. But now I learned: the stream is too wide to jump. Let me try a DIFFERENT way."  
  Second attempt: "I'll use those stepping stones instead!"  
  Animation shows Penny successfully crossing on stones  
  "Success! I persisted by trying again with a better plan."  
  "Now YOU try. When something doesn't work, watch carefully to learn WHY, then adjust!"  
- Button: "Enter the Path!" → begins Challenge 1

**UI Elements:**
- Path Map (top): Shows 5 checkpoints, current position marked
- Persistence Meter (left side): Tracks retry attempts positively (fills with each try)
- Outcome Display (center): Shows result of each attempt
- Try Counter (top right): "Attempt: 1"
- Challenge Counter (top left): "Challenge 1 of 5"
- "Learn & Adjust" button (appears after failed attempts)

---

### Play
**Gameplay Loop (5 persistence challenges):**

**Challenge Structure:**  
Each challenge presents a problem with 3–4 solution options. Players must:
- Choose a solution
- See outcome (often fails first time)
- Learn from failure
- Adjust approach
- Try again until success

#### CHALLENGE 1: The Tall Shelf
**Problem:** "You need a book from a high shelf, but you can't reach it."

**Attempt 1 — Initial Choice:**
Options displayed:  
A) Jump to try to reach it  
B) Use a chair to stand on  
C) Ask someone taller for help  
D) Use a broom to knock it down  

Player selects one

**Outcome & Cause-Effect:**
- Option A (Jump): Animation shows Penny jumping, still can't reach. "That didn't work. WHY? The shelf is too high for jumping. What could I try differently?"  
  "Learn & Adjust" button appears → shows that jumping doesn't add enough height  
  Persistence Meter fills +1  
- Option B (Chair): Success! "That worked! Using tools helps solve problems." → Earn 3 stars, move to Challenge 2  
- Option C (Ask help): Success! "Smart! Asking for help is efficient." → Earn 3 stars, move to Challenge 2  
- Option D (Broom): Partial success but risky. "It worked, but the book fell hard. A safer way might be better next time." → Earn 2 stars, move to Challenge 2  

If player chose A (failed attempt):

**Attempt 2 — Retry with Learning:**
Path Walker Penny: "Jumping didn't work because the shelf is too high. Let's think: what gives me more height?"  
New options displayed (guided choices):  
B) Use a chair  
C) Ask someone taller  
E) Stack two cushions to stand on  

Player selects  
Any reasonable choice: Success! "You persisted! You learned from the first try and adjusted. That's smart problem-solving!" → Earn 2 stars (slightly fewer for needing retry, but still rewarded), move to Challenge 2  

**Scientific Frame:** "Scientists often fail first! But they learn from failures and adjust. You just did that!"

#### CHALLENGE 2: The Stuck Puzzle Piece
**Problem:** "You're doing a puzzle, but one piece won't fit where you think it goes."

**Attempt 1:**
Options:  
A) Force the piece into the spot  
B) Try rotating the piece  
C) Look for a different spot for this piece  
D) Ask for help checking the picture

**Outcomes:**
- Option A: Fails. "That didn't work and might damage the piece. WHY? Maybe it's the wrong spot or angle. Try again!"  
  Persistence Meter +1  
- Attempt 2: Options B or C shown → leads to success  
- Options B, C, or D: Success scenarios → 3 stars

#### CHALLENGE 3: The Friend Conflict
**Problem:** "Your friend is upset with you, but you don't know why."

**Attempt 1:**
Options:  
A) Ignore it and hope they feel better  
B) Ask directly: "Are you upset? Can we talk?"  
C) Apologize even though you don't know what's wrong  
D) Avoid your friend  

**Outcomes:**
- Option A or D: Fails. "That made things worse. Your friend still seems upset. WHY? Avoiding doesn't solve the problem. What else could you try?"  
  Persistence Meter +1  
- Attempt 2: Suggests communication options → leads to resolution  
- Options B or C: Success → 3 stars

A) Give up and throw it away  
B) Try adding more details  
C) Ask someone for drawing tips  
D) Start over with a new plan  

**Outcomes:**
- Option A: Fails (giving up). "That's quitting, not adjusting! Even if it's hard, what could you TRY to improve it?"  
  Persistence Meter +1  
- Attempt 2: Options B, C, or D shown → success  
- Options B, C, or D: Success scenarios → 3 stars

### Continuity Note
This game directly applies Lesson 4's core concept: persistence means trying again with adjustments, not giving up. By experiencing failure in a safe, game-based environment and seeing how learning from outcomes leads to success, players internalize resilience. The cause-effect chain format makes the "learn → adjust → retry" process explicit and visible, building metacognitive awareness of adaptive problem-solving.

## Home Game 4B – Help Network: Build Your Support Web
> Jump to: [Setup](#setup-1) · [Play](#play-1) · [Scoring](#scoring-1) · [Win Condition](#win-condition-1) · [Continuity Note](#continuity-note-1)

### Learning Objective
Students recognize that problem-solving is often a shared process where we use our own tools and also rely on others' perspectives. They demonstrate help-seeking by identifying when and how to ask for support.

### Game File Name & Format
`hg-08.04-02.html` — Classification Trees / Network Builder

### Game Purpose
Reinforce that asking for help is strategic and smart. Players learn to match problem types with appropriate helpers, understanding that help-seeking is about knowing WHO can best support with WHAT kind of problem.

### Estimated Play Time
9–11 minutes (1.5–2 minutes per level × 6 levels)

---

### Setup
**Opening Screen:**
- Title: "Help Network: Build Your Support Web"
- Background: Network diagram style with glowing connection lines
- Character introduction: Meet Network Builder Nova (cartoon child holding connecting cables/lines, friendly expression)
- Instructions: "You're never alone when solving problems! You have a HELP NETWORK—people and resources that can support you. Let's build your network by connecting problems to the right helpers!"
- Helper Types displayed (four categories with icons):  
  👤 SELF (blue) — "I can handle this on my own"  
  👥 FRIENDS (green) — "My friends can help with this"  
  👨‍👩‍👧 FAMILY (orange) — "My family is good for this kind of help"  
  👩‍🏫 TEACHERS/ADULTS (purple) — "Adults at school or in community can help"  
- Button: "Build Network" → begins tutorial

**Tutorial (30 seconds):**
- Network Builder Nova demonstrates:  
  "Look at this problem: 'I forgot my pencil.' Who could help?"  
  Shows four helper nodes (Self, Friends, Family, Teachers)  
  "I could solve this MYSELF by borrowing from supplies. Or I could ask a FRIEND. Or a TEACHER. Multiple connections work!"  
  Draws connection lines from problem to Self, Friend, and Teacher  
  "See? This problem has THREE good helpers in my network. Strong networks have many connections!"  
  Simple practice: Player connects one problem to helpers  
- Button: "Start Building!" → begins Level 1

**UI Elements:**
- Network Web (center): Visual node-and-connection diagram
- Problem Node (left side): Current problem displayed in a circle
- Helper Nodes (right side): Four helper type circles (Self, Friends, Family, Teachers)
- Connection Lines: Player draws lines between problem and helpers
- Network Strength Meter (top): Shows how complete the network is
- Level Counter (top left): "Level 1 of 6"
- Connection Points (top right): "Points: 0"

### Play
**Gameplay Loop (6 network-building levels):**

**Level Structure:**
- Problem Presentation:
  - A problem node appears on left side of screen
  - Examples of 6 problems:
    - Level 1: "You don't understand the math homework."
    - Level 2: "You're feeling sad but don't know why."
    - Level 3: "You want to learn to ride a bike."
    - Level 4: "Someone took your pencil without asking."
    - Level 5: "You're worried about an upcoming school event."
    - Level 6: "Your group project teammates aren't doing their part."

**Helper Selection & Connection:**
- Four helper nodes displayed on right: 👤 Self | 👥 Friends | 👨‍👩‍👧 Family | 👩‍🏫 Teachers/Adults
- Task: Player drags connection lines from the problem node to appropriate helper node(s)
- Drawing Mechanic: Click problem node → drag line to helper node → line "sticks" and glows
- Player can connect to multiple helpers (most problems have 2–4 valid connections)

**Evaluation Phase:**
- After player makes connections, "Test Network" button appears
- Player clicks button
- Network Builder Nova evaluates each connection:

**Level 1 Example: "You don't understand math homework"**
- SELF connection: "Good! You could try again on your own, look at examples, or use tools." ✓ Valid  
- FRIENDS connection: "Maybe... but they might not understand it either. This might not be the best helper for this problem." ~ Questionable  
- FAMILY connection: "Yes! Family members can explain or help you practice." ✓ Valid  
- TEACHERS connection: "Perfect! Teachers are experts at explaining schoolwork." ✓ Valid

**Scoring & Feedback:**
- Optimal Connections (3–4 appropriate helpers): "Strong network! You identified the best helpers for this problem!" → Earn 100 points  
- Good Connections (2 appropriate helpers): "Solid network! You found good helpers." → Earn 75 points  
- Partial Connections (1 appropriate helper or included questionable ones): "Your network works, but could be stronger. Think about who's BEST for this type of problem." → Earn 50 points  
- Network Strength Meter fills based on connection quality

**Learning Moment:**
Network Builder Nova explains WHY certain connections work:  
"Teachers are great for school problems because they're trained to help you learn."  
"Family is good for personal worries because they know you well and care about you."  
"Friends help with social problems because they understand kid perspectives."  
"Self works when you have the skills and confidence to try independently."

**Scientific Frame Reinforcement:**
- After Level 2: "Scientists work in teams! They know that asking experts and collaborators makes their work stronger. Same with you!"
- After Level 4: "Help-seeking is strategic. Smart problem-solvers know WHO to ask for WHAT kind of help."

**Network Complexity Increases:**
- Later levels present more nuanced problems requiring careful matching  
- Level 5–6: Some problems have "best" vs. "okay" helpers—player must prioritize

**Progression:**
- "Next Problem" button → loads next level
- Previous networks stay visible in background (web grows with each level)
- Repeat for all 6 levels

---

### Scoring
**Connection Points System:**
- 100 points per level: Optimal helper connections (3–4 appropriate)
- 75 points per level: Good connections (2 appropriate)
- 50 points per level: Partial connections (1 appropriate or mixed quality)
- **Bonus Points:**
  - Network Master (+100 points): Optimal connections on at least 5 out of 6 levels
  - Strategic Helper (+50 points): Correctly identify "BEST" helper (not just "okay") on at least 4 levels
  - Complete Web (+75 points): Finish all 6 levels  
  - **Maximum possible:** 600 points (6 × 100) + 225 bonus points = 825 points total  

Display: Points accumulate after each level. Network Strength Meter shows overall network quality. Visual web grows more connected and colorful with each level.

### Continuity Note
This game completes Lesson 4's message that problem-solving is collaborative and that help-seeking is strategic, not weak. By visually mapping problems to appropriate helpers, players internalize that different challenges require different types of support. Combined with Game 4A (which taught persistence through retrying), this game shows the full picture: try, adjust, and know when to bring in help. Together, the two games in Lesson 4 prepare students to be both self-reliant AND collaborative—the hallmark of effective problem-solvers.

## How Lesson 4 Fits into the Full Learning Arc

Lesson 4 concludes Unit 8 by integrating **persistence and collaboration**—the two essential mindsets that transform problem-solving from an individual exercise into a sustainable life skill. After learning in earlier lessons how to *recognise problems* (Lesson 1), *apply a clear process* (Lesson 2), and *think flexibly* (Lesson 3), students now practise **staying engaged when solutions fail** and **knowing when to seek help**. The two home games—*Persistence Path* and *Help Network*—translate these abstract ideas into concrete, interactive experiences where failure becomes feedback and help-seeking becomes strategy.

- **Lesson 1:** Normalises problems as everyday challenges and introduces the mindset that every mind can handle them.  
- **Lesson 2:** Provides a structured, repeatable method for tackling problems through the four-step model.  
- **Lesson 3:** Builds flexible thinking and creative option-generation.  
- **Lesson 4 (this document):** Develops perseverance and intelligent help-seeking, reinforcing that persistence and collaboration strengthen each other.

> 🧩 **Learning Arc Summary:** Recognising → Structuring → Expanding → Persevering.  
> Through this final lesson, students internalise that effective problem-solvers are both **resilient** and **connected**—they try again, refine their approach, and draw on others’ perspectives when needed. This completes the Unit 8 foundation for self-efficacy and resilience, preparing students for Unit 9’s exploration of how their actions create real-world effects.
