> Jump to: [Setup](#setup) · [Play](#play) · [Scoring](#scoring) · [Win Condition](#win-condition) · [Continuity Note](#continuity-note)

### Learning Objective
Students recognize that problems are normal, everyday experiences that everyone faces. They categorize problems by size (small, medium, larger) and understand that problems are opportunities for the mind to work, not signs of failure.

### Game File Name & Format
`hg-08.01-01.html` — Point-and-Click Exploration

### Game Purpose
Reinforce that problems exist everywhere in daily life and can be observed, identified, and categorized. Players explore environments to find problems "in the wild" rather than being presented with them passively, building scientific observation skills.

### Estimated Play Time
8–10 minutes (30–50 seconds per problem × 12 problems, including exploration time)

### Continuity Note
This game builds on Lesson 1's core message that problems are normal and everywhere. The exploration format puts players in an active scientific role—observing, discovering, and classifying—rather than passively receiving information. This prepares players for Lesson 2 by establishing comfort with problem identification (the "Stop and Notice" step), and sets up the idea that once we notice problems, we can approach them systematically. The island metaphor positions problem-solving as an adventure, not something to fear.

## Home Game 1B – Mind Toolbox: Match the Problem to the Tool
> Jump to: [Setup](#setup-1) · [Play](#play-1) · [Scoring](#scoring-1) · [Win Condition](#win-condition-1) · [Continuity Note](#continuity-note-1)

### Learning Objective
Students shift perspective to see problems as opportunities, not something "bad." They understand that problems are like puzzles meant to be figured out using the mind's tools (thinking, feeling, doing).

### Game File Name & Format
`hg-08.01-02.html` — Drag-and-Drop Lab

### Game Purpose
Reinforce that the mind has specific tools (thinking, feeling, doing) that can be applied to problems. Players discover through experimentation which tools work best for different problem types, building scientific hypothesis-testing skills.

### Estimated Play Time
9–11 minutes (60–80 seconds per experiment × 8 experiments)

### Continuity Note
This game deepens Lesson 1's concept that problems are opportunities by introducing the three mind tools framework. By experimenting with tool combinations, players discover that different problems require different approaches—previewing the flexibility and structured thinking they'll need in Lessons 2–4. The scientific experimentation format builds hypothesis-testing skills and positions the player as an active researcher of their own mind's capabilities.

## How Lesson 1 Fits into the Full Learning Arc

Lesson 1 launches Unit 8 by reframing **problems as normal parts of life** and introducing the mindset that challenges are opportunities for the mind to work. The two home games extend this concept into active exploration and experimentation: *Problem Explorer* encourages children to identify and classify problems in the world around them, while *Mind Toolbox* transforms abstract mental processes into tangible “tools” that can be tested and applied.

- **Lesson 1 (this document):** Normalises problems as everyday occurrences and introduces the idea that the mind’s tools—thinking, feeling, and doing—are resources for solving them.  
- **Lesson 2:** Teaches the structured four-step problem-solving model (Stop and Notice → Think of Options → Choose One → Try It Out), giving students a reliable process to follow.  
- **Lesson 3:** Expands on flexible thinking and creativity, showing that there is often more than one good solution to a problem.  
- **Lesson 4:** Builds persistence and social support skills, reframing “asking for help” as a strength rather than weakness.

> 🧠 **Learning Arc Summary:** Recognising Problems → Understanding Tools → Applying Steps → Building Resilience.  
> Through this arc, students shift from *noticing that problems exist* to *confidently engaging with them* using structured, flexible, and persistent approaches. By the end of the unit, they understand that problem-solving is both a cognitive and emotional skill—rooted in observation, experimentation, and the belief that “I can handle challenges.”
