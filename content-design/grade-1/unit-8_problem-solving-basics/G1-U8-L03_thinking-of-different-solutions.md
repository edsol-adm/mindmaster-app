# Lesson 3: Thinking of Different Solutions

## Lesson Objective
Students will understand that most problems do not have only one “right” answer—there are usually many possible solutions.  
They will practise generating at least three different ways to solve a problem and comparing which might work best.  
They will learn that **creativity, flexibility, and trying new ideas are strengths**, not signs of confusion, and that thinking in multiple directions builds confidence and problem-solving power.

## Warm-Up (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *“How Many Ways Can You…?”*  

Hold up a simple object (e.g., pencil, piece of paper, block).  
Ask:
> “How many different ways can you use this?”  

Record or repeat student answers aloud (write with it, build with it, draw, measure, pretend it’s a puppet, etc.).  
After 5–7 ideas, say:
> “Look! One object, many different uses. Our brains are creative. Problems work the same way—there’s more than one way to solve them.”  

**Psychology Frame:**  
> “Scientists call this flexible thinking. It means imagining different ways to reach a goal. Flexible thinkers find more solutions—and that’s a sign of a strong brain.”

## Explore + Practice (30 minutes)

### Explore A: Video – Creativity and Problem-Solving (3 min)

**Media:** YouTube Video  
**Title:** *“Rube Goldberg Machines: Creative Problem-Solving in Action”*  
**Link:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_A4rLmqqCW0  
**Duration:** ~2 minutes  

> **Note:** This video is *indicative only*. In the full MindMaster version, a copyright-free or modified video will be featured to illustrate the same concept of flexible problem-solving.

**Teacher Setup:**  
Play the video. Pause halfway and ask:  
> “Did the character use just ONE way to solve the problem, or MANY ways?”  
> “Why do you think they tried different ideas?”  

Emphasise that trying different ideas is a *superpower* of flexible thinkers.

### Practice A: Brainstorming Station – Generate Multiple Solutions (12 min)

**Materials:** Large paper or whiteboard, markers; 3–4 scenario cards (printed).  

**Scenarios:**  
- **A.** You want to play with a toy, but your friend is using it and it’s not time to switch yet.  
- **B.** You finished your classwork early, but others are still working.  
- **C.** Two children want to sit next to each other at lunch, but there’s only one empty seat.  
- **D.** You can’t open a jar of paint during art time.  

**Activity Flow**

1️⃣ **Group Setup:** Divide class into 3–4 small groups (4–5 students). Assign each a scenario.  
2️⃣ **Brainstorm (8 min):**  
   - Write the scenario on large paper.  
   - Ask: “How many different ways could someone solve this?”  
   - Students call out ideas; a “scribe” writes or draws *all* ideas—serious or silly.  
   - Goal = 5–7 ideas per group.  
   - Encourage: “That’s a wild idea—write it down anyway!”  
3️⃣ **Gallery Walk (2 min):** Post group papers around the room. Have students circulate and read each other’s ideas.  
4️⃣ **Whole-Class Debrief (2 min):** Ask:  
   - “Did any group find exactly ONE right answer?”  
   - “What surprised you about the different ideas?”  
   Affirm: “Real-life problems work like that—many answers can fit, depending on the situation.”

**Science Frame:**  
> “Scientists call this *generative thinking*—the brain’s ability to imagine many possibilities. You just showed your generative thinking superpower!”

---

### Practice B: Comparing Solutions – Which Fits Best? (8 min)

**Materials:** Worksheet or slide with one problem and four possible solutions.  

**Problem Example:**  
“You want to play tag, but your friend wants to play hide-and-seek. You both really want your own game.”  

**Four Solutions:**  
A. Take turns—play tag first, then hide-and-seek.  
B. Combine both into ‘Tag-and-Seek.’  
C. Ask another friend to vote.  
D. Each play separately.  

**Activity Flow**
1️⃣ **Individual Work (2 min):** “Read the problem. Circle the one you think fits best. Why?”  
2️⃣ **Pair Share (2 min):** “Which one did you pick? Why?” Listen to partner’s reason.  
3️⃣ **Whole-Class Share (2 min):** “Who picked A? B? C? D?”  
4️⃣ **Teacher Wrap-Up (2 min):**  
> “Different answers can all work—it depends on what fits best. That’s what flexible thinkers do: they don’t look for the *one right answer*, they look for what works.”

**Key Concept:** Context matters — the “best” solution depends on the situation.

### Practice C: MindMaster Game – “Multiple Solutions Explorer” (7 min)

**Format:** Matching / Sorting Game  
**Objective:** Reinforce that multiple answers can work.

**Game Flow:**  
1️⃣ Display one problem on the left (e.g., “Your friend wants to play a different game than you”).  
2️⃣ Show 4–5 possible solutions on the right (“Play their game,” “Take turns,” “Mix both games,” “Ask teacher,” “Play separately”).  
3️⃣ Students use clickers to select which solutions would *work*.  
4️⃣ After each round, display the range of answers and say:  
> “I see different answers—that’s great! There’s often more than one good way.”  
5️⃣ Repeat for 5–6 problems.  
6️⃣ Scoring: +1 for any reasonable choice; bonus for unique, creative reasoning.  

**Win Condition:**  
Top scores = “Flexible Thinkers!”  
Celebrate multiple correct answers, not just one.

**When in lesson:** After Practice B, as reinforcement before reflection.  

**Science Frame:**  
> “You just proved that the brain can imagine many paths to success. That’s what real scientists do—they test multiple ideas!”

---

## Reflection (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *Flexible Thinking Is a Strength*  

**MindMaster Reflection (Clicker Poll):**  
Show on screen:  
> “Which statement is TRUE about problem-solving?”  
> (A) There is always ONE right answer.  
> (B) There are usually MANY possible answers, and the best one depends on the situation.  
> (C) Creative ideas are silly and don’t help.  

Students vote via clickers.  
Reveal results — emphasise (B).  

Ask follow-up aloud:  
- “Why is B true?” → “Because every problem is different.”  
- “Why might someone think A is true?” → “Because tests at school usually have one answer.”  
- “What does it mean when someone has a creative idea?” → “It means their brain is flexible!”  

**Teacher Closing:**  
> “Flexible thinking—imagining different ways to solve a problem—is how good problem-solvers work.  
> That’s your superpower.”

## Home Prep (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *Practice Flexible Thinking at Home*  

**Teacher Instructions:**  
> “Tonight, pick one small problem—like choosing what to wear or deciding what game to play. Try to think of three different ways to solve it.  
> You don’t have to do all three—just imagine them. Tomorrow, tell us your problem and your three ideas. We’ll celebrate your flexible thinking!”

**Optional:**  
If students have access to MindMaster at home, assign the reflection activity “Flexible Thinking Speed Challenge.”

---

## Connection to Unit Arc
Lesson 2 introduced a four-step process.  
Lesson 3 deepens **Step 2 – Think of Options**, showing that good problem-solvers **generate multiple solutions** and **compare them** before deciding.  
This develops **mental flexibility**, preparing students for Lesson 4, which focuses on **persistence and help-seeking** when solutions don’t work the first time.
