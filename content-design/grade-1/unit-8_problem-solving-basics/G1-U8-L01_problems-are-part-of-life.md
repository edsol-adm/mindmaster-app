# Lesson 1: Problems Are Part of Life

## Lesson Objective
Students will recognise that **problems are normal, everyday experiences** that everyone—children and adults—faces.  
They will learn that problems are not signs of failure or shame, but **opportunities for the mind to use its tools** (thinking, feeling, doing) to find solutions.  
By categorising, observing, and sharing, they begin to see that approaching problems with curiosity builds confidence and resilience.

## Warm-Up (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *Let’s Notice Problems Around Us*  

Display three simple pictures on screen or board:  
1️⃣ A child with a broken crayon.  
2️⃣ Two children arguing over a toy.  
3️⃣ A child looking nervous before speaking to the class.  

Ask:  
> “What do you see happening in each picture? Is it a problem? Why or why not?”

Take brief responses, then guide:  
> “All three show a problem—something that needs figuring out. Let’s discover what problems really are.”

**Psychology as Science Frame:**  
> “Today we’re acting like scientists studying how minds and people handle challenges.  
> What we discover will help us understand why problems aren’t scary—they’re puzzles our brains can solve.”

## Explore + Practice (30 minutes)

### Explore A: Video – Problems as Puzzles (5 min)

**Media:** YouTube Video  
**Title:** *“What Is a Problem? An Everyday Explainer”*  
**Link:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8LqYe0EkKI  
**Duration:** ~2 minutes  

> **Note:** This video is *indicative only*. In the full MindMaster version, a copyright-free or modified video will be featured to illustrate the same concept of problems as puzzles.

**How to use:**  
1. Play the video once.  
2. Pause midway and ask: “What problem did the character notice? What tools did they use?”  
3. Reinforce: “The character *noticed* the problem first—that’s always Step 1.”  

Optional alternative videos: search “problem solving for kids” on YouTube for any 2-minute clip showing characters recognising everyday problems.

### Practice A: Classroom Stories + Size Sorting (12 min)

**Materials:** Hard-copy handout with 6–8 simple problem scenarios (text + illustration)  

Examples:  
- **Small:** Forgetting your pencil at home; spilling your drink.  
- **Medium:** Friend wants to play a different game; can’t find your shoe.  
- **Larger:** Feeling scared before a performance; two friends won’t talk.

**Activity Flow**

1️⃣ **Group Setup** – Divide class into pairs or small groups (3–4 students). Give each group 2–3 scenario cards (a mix of sizes).  
2️⃣ **Group Task** – Without teacher input, students sort their cards into three piles: **Small Problem / Medium Problem / Bigger Problem**.  
3️⃣ **Gallery Walk** – Each group places their piles on a desk or floor space. Invite groups to walk around and observe each other’s sorts.  
4️⃣ **Prompting Questions** – “Any surprises? Why might groups sort differently?”  
5️⃣ **Whole-Class Share & Debrief** – Ask 2–3 groups to explain one choice. Emphasise:  
> “There’s no one ‘right’ answer. What matters is noticing what makes a problem small or big—how hard it is to solve or how many people it affects.”  

**Science Frame:**  
> “When scientists study problems, they first notice and name what kind they are. You just did that! You’re acting like problem scientists.”

### Practice B: Psychology Experiment – “What Problems Do You Notice?” (8 min)

**Type:** In-Class Observation Experiment  
**Objective:** Students notice and name real problems from their own week, discovering that they already solve problems without realising it.

**Setup & Steps**
1️⃣ **Prepare:** Give each student a small slip of paper and a pencil.  
2️⃣ **Think Quietly (1 min):** “Think of ONE problem you had this week—something small, medium, or big. It could be at school, home, or with friends.”  
3️⃣ **Draw or Write (2 min):** “Draw or write what the problem was using simple pictures or words.”  
4️⃣ **Pair Share (2 min):** Students turn to a neighbour and share briefly:  
 “My problem was … I solved it by …” or “I’m still figuring it out.”  
5️⃣ **Reflect (1 min):** Ask the class:  
 “Hands up if you solved your problem.”  
 “Hands up if you got help.”  
 “Hands up if you’re still working on it.”  
Count and celebrate each group.  

**Teacher Closing:**  
> “See? Everyone here has problems—and everyone here is already a problem-solver!”

**Science Frame:**  
> “This is like a scientist’s observation task. You noticed that problems are everywhere, and your brain is always working on them. That’s what brains do—they solve puzzles.”

### Practice C: MindMaster Game – “Sort the Problems” (5 min)

**Game Type:** Clicker-based Sorting Game  

**Game Setup & Flow**
1️⃣ Display one problem scenario at a time (e.g., “Your pencil breaks during math class.”).  
2️⃣ Students use clickers to select: 1 = Small Problem; 2 = Medium Problem; 3 = Bigger Problem.  
3️⃣ After each round, show the majority answer and explain briefly (e.g., “Most said medium—yes, because it involves two people.”).  
4️⃣ Play 8–10 rounds; award 1 point per correct sort.  
5️⃣ Display leaderboard and celebrate participation.  

**When in lesson:** Use after Practice B (Pair Shares).  
**Purpose:** Reinforces categorisation and normalises variation in problem types.

## Reflection (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *Now You Know: Problems Are Normal*  

Seat students in a circle or on the carpet.  
Explain they will reflect as scientists.

**Prompts (with sample student responses):**  
- “What did you notice about problems today?” → “I saw lots of different problems.”  
- “Why do you think everyone has problems?” → “Because brains are always noticing things that need fixing.”  
- “Is having a problem a bad thing or a normal thing?” → “Normal—it’s how brains work.”  
- “Next lesson we’ll learn steps to solve problems. Why might having steps help?” → “So we don’t feel stuck.”  

**Teacher Guidance:** Listen to 3–4 students. Affirm every response that shows curiosity or insight.  

**Closing Line:**  
> “Great noticing. You’re already thinking like problem-solving scientists.”

## Home Prep (5 minutes)

**Activity:** *Get Ready for MindMaster at Home*  

**Teacher Explanation:**  
> “Tonight, you can play a MindMaster game on our class device (or your family’s tablet if available). Your job is to keep spotting problems during your day—at dinner, playing, getting ready for bed. Just notice them. You don’t have to solve them yet—just say, ‘That’s a problem!’ Tomorrow, you’ll tell us what you noticed.”  

**If MindMaster not available at home:**  
> “Tonight, draw or list 2–3 small problems you notice at home. Bring your list tomorrow so we can add them to our classroom collection.”

## Connection to Unit Arc
**Lesson 1 → Lesson 2:** This lesson establishes that problems are normal and everywhere, building comfort with the idea that problems deserve attention rather than avoidance.  
**Next Step:** Lesson 2 builds on this foundation by teaching the four steps students can use to solve them — moving from *“noticing problems exist”* to *“having a process to solve them.”*
