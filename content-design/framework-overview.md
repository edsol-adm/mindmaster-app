# 📘 MindMaster Curriculum Framework — Overview

## 1. Vision and Purpose

MindMaster is a primary-level **psychology literacy** programme designed to build mental resilience, self-understanding, and cognitive skills in children aged 6–12.  

While traditional **Social Emotional Learning (SEL)** programmes have been widely endorsed and implemented globally, their impact has remained largely **short-term and surface-level**. SEL focuses on teaching coping behaviours — emotional regulation scripts, interpersonal routines, and social skills — but it does **not teach learners how their mind works**. As a result, children often remain **dependent**, applying coping strategies without the deeper understanding required to generalise, adapt, and sustain resilience over time.

**Psychology Literacy**, the foundation of MindMaster, directly addresses this gap. Instead of training children to manage symptoms reactively, it **teaches the science of the mind proactively** — how attention, memory, emotion, perception, and reasoning function and interact. By understanding these mechanisms, learners build lasting **mental agency**, **self-regulation**, and **adaptive problem-solving skills**.

If SEL is *symptom management*, **Psychology Literacy is root cause empowerment** — equipping children not merely to cope, but to **understand**, **adapt**, and **thrive**. In a world facing rising mental health crises, this shift represents a decisive step from reactive support toward preventive, evidence-based resilience building.

## 2. Modular Development Roadmap

The MindMaster curriculum is structured as **three sequential modules**, allowing for scalable, phased development. This ensures that each module is **self-contained**, delivering a fully operational product at every stage.

| Module | Grade Coverage | Core Deliverables | Strategic Value |
|--------|----------------|--------------------|------------------|
| **Module 1** | Grade 1 | • Full curriculum (10 units, 40 lessons)  <br>• Student platform with gamified lessons, chatbot, and Adaptive Learning Tool (ALT) <br>• Teacher Assistant Dashboard <br>• Deployment and training toolkit | **UNICEF funding focus** — Complete and market-ready product |
| **Module 2** | Grades 2–3 | • Expansion of curriculum spiral <br>• Additional game-based activities <br>• Enhanced data analytics and classroom sync features | Scale to new NGO and school partners |
| **Module 3** | Grades 4–6 | • Full 6-year primary curriculum <br>• Advanced personalisation and longitudinal learning analytics | Nationwide / international expansion |

**Why Modular?**  
- De-risks development by ensuring early delivery of impact.  
- Enables immediate market deployment after Module 1.  
- Supports iterative evaluation and improvement.  
- Aligns with UNICEF’s milestone-based funding structure.

## 3. UNICEF Venture Fund — Module 1 Focus

The proposed one-year development period will deliver:

- ✅ A **complete Grade 1 learning platform** — fully functional and implementable.  
- 🧠 A **10-unit spiral curriculum** covering foundational psychological concepts (e.g. attention, memory, emotions, problem-solving, imagination).  
- 🧑‍🏫 A **Teacher Assistant Platform** with progress monitoring, classroom sync, and resource access.  
- 🌐 **Hybrid deployment** capability (cloud-first + offline intranet).  
- 🤝 Implementation with NGO partners and pilot schools in Thailand.

> This means UNICEF’s investment produces a **market-ready product** capable of real-world impact from Year 1.

## 4. Expansion Strategy Beyond Year 1

Post-Module 1, the MindMaster platform can rapidly scale:

- **Curriculum extension**: Add Grades 2–6 while retaining the same pedagogical and technological foundation.  
- **Partner growth**: Broaden access through existing NGO networks and new school partnerships.  
- **Data-driven enhancement**: Leverage usage data to refine personalisation and adaptive learning.

This phased strategy ensures the programme matures sustainably while delivering measurable outcomes early.
