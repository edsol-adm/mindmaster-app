## 🚧 MindMaster Development Stages

1. **UNICEF Venture Fund would support MindMaster’s initial development in English.**  
   This phase focuses on developing core content and infrastructure, along with piloting the solution in low-resource educational settings.

2. **Use evidence from the English version to secure co-investment for local language adaptation.**  
   EdSol will engage strategic partners—NGOs, government agencies, and philanthropic funders—to co-develop Thai, Khmer, and additional low-resource language versions.  
   The platform is designed from the outset to support multilingual localization and inclusive content delivery.
