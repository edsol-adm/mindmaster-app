# MindMaster: Psychology Literacy App for Mental Resilience

**MindMaster** is developed for all children in **Primary Grades 1–6**—but is especially valuable for **girls**, who often face heightened emotional, social, and structural challenges that affect their mental well-being.

It is an open-source educational platform designed to equip primary-level learners—particularly girls and those in underserved communities—with foundational psychological knowledge and emotional tools to build mental resilience.

Through gamified lessons, interactive reflection, and digital journaling, MindMaster helps children explore concepts like self-efficacy, mindfulness, and emotional regulation in an age-appropriate and inclusive way.

Girls often face unique emotional and structural challenges—ranging from higher risks of anxiety and depression to barriers in accessing mental health support. MindMaster is designed to address these inequities early, empowering girls with tools to build confidence, express emotions safely, and develop psychological resilience.

To ensure broad accessibility, the platform can be deployed **online or offline via Local Server Deployment**, enabling use in low-connectivity environments such as rural schools or community centers. This makes MindMaster a powerful, scalable solution for advancing gender equity in mental health literacy and early emotional support.

## 🌱 Purpose

MindMaster promotes emotional wellbeing, psychological literacy, and academic resilience among children aged 6–12. By combining technology with evidence-based pedagogy, the platform supports early intervention and lifelong mental health awareness.

The solution is intentionally designed to serve girls and marginalized children who often face systemic barriers to mental health support. To address the digital divide, MindMaster is designed to operate in both **online and offline modes**—using **Local Server Deployment** technology to function without internet access. This ensures children—especially girls in marginalized and remote communities—can benefit from quality digital learning environments, regardless of infrastructure limitations. The platform supports caregivers, educators, and humanitarian organizations in nurturing emotional growth with tools that are inclusive, adaptable, and community-ready.

## 🚧 MindMaster Development Stages

1. **UNICEF Venture Fund would support MindMaster’s initial development in English.**  
   This phase focuses on developing core content and infrastructure, along with piloting the solution in low-resource educational settings.

2. **Use evidence from the English version to secure co-investment for local language adaptation.**  
   EdSol will engage strategic partners—NGOs, government agencies, and philanthropic funders—to co-develop Thai, Khmer, and additional low-resource language versions.  
   The platform is designed from the outset to support multilingual localization and inclusive content delivery.
