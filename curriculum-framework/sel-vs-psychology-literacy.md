# üß† SEL vs Psychology Literacy ‚Äî Evidence-Based Comparison

This document compares the widely implemented **Social Emotional Learning (SEL)** model with the **Psychology Literacy** paradigm underpinning the MindMaster programme.  
It highlights key conceptual, pedagogical, and resilience-building differences based on existing research evidence and global mental health trends.

## üìä Core Conceptual and Practical Differences

| Dimension | SEL (Social Emotional Learning) | Psychology Literacy |
|-----------|---------------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Core Orientation** | Teaches *what to do* to manage emotions and social situations. | Teaches *how the mind works* ‚Äî cognitive, emotional, and behavioural mechanisms. |
| **Theoretical Foundation** | Skills-based pedagogy (CASEL competencies). Focus on behavioural outcomes. | Scientific literacy of psychological systems ‚Äî cognition, emotion, attention, memory, reasoning, self-regulation. |
| **Learner Role** | Passive recipient of emotional regulation techniques and social skills. | Active investigator of their own mind ‚Äî learns mechanisms, tests, applies, adapts. |
| **Depth of Learning** | Surface-level: procedural knowledge (e.g. ‚Äúcount to 10 when angry‚Äù). | Deep conceptual knowledge: mechanistic understanding of emotional and cognitive processes. |
| **Time Horizon of Effects** | Empirical studies show modest short- to medium-term effects; limited evidence of sustained long-term impact. | Designed for long-term resilience by enabling learners to self-diagnose, self-regulate, and adapt over time. |
| **Focus** | Coping, behavioural compliance, emotional regulation. | Understanding, agency, adaptive problem-solving, self-leadership. |
| **Mental Health Model** | Treats learners implicitly as *at-risk subjects needing tools*. | Treats learners as *capable cognitive agents* who can learn, understand, and master their mind. |
| **Agency and Autonomy** | Low: scripts and routines are given externally. | High: learners develop mental models, can design their own coping strategies. |
| **Generalisation & Transfer** | Context-dependent. Skills often don‚Äôt transfer to new stressors. | Mechanism-based knowledge generalises across situations and scales with age. |
| **Resilience Building** | Limited. Focus on mitigation of symptoms, not root understanding. | Core objective. Builds psychological flexibility and resilience through literacy and reasoning. |
| **Assessment** | Behavioural checklists, teacher observation, self-report. | Conceptual mastery tasks, scenario reasoning, transfer application. |
| **Implementation** | Programme-dependent; often fragile when fidelity is low. | Curriculum-embedded, conceptually integrated; less fragile to implementation variance. |
| **Scalability** | Requires significant teacher training, resource heavy. | Knowledge-centric; easier to scale through digital and open learning frameworks. |
| **Underlying Assumption** | Mental health is maintained by practising coping behaviours. | Mental health resilience is strengthened by understanding, sense-making, and agency. |
| **Suicide Prevention Relevance** | Indirect, limited impact; may offer protective buffers but not deep prevention. | Direct relevance through building awareness of mental states, meta-cognition, and early self-help literacy. |
| **Crisis Adaptability** | Weak ‚Äî SEL scripts often fail in high-intensity crises. | Stronger potential ‚Äî literacy enables learners to reframe and adapt under stress. |

## üß≠ Strategic Takeaway

- SEL has made important contributions in building foundational social and emotional skills, but its impact on **long-term mental health resilience** has been modest and time-limited.  
- This is because SEL largely focuses on *coping strategies and behavioural skills* without fully equipping learners to understand how their own mind works.  
- **Psychology Literacy** builds on this foundation by teaching *the science of mental processes* ‚Äî giving learners **agency**, **conceptual understanding**, and **transferable resilience**.  
- If SEL focuses on coping, **Psychology Literacy focuses on root cause empowerment**, offering a pathway to deeper, longer-lasting impact.
