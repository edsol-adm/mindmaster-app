## Grade 1: Introduction to Psychology

**Focus:**  
Understanding how minds work (thinking, feeling, doing), information processing (senses, attention, memory, imagination), and applying psychological knowledge to relationships, problem-solving, and collaboration.

**Unit Sequence**
1. What is Psychology?  
2. Exploring Our Senses (Sight, Sound, Touch)  
3. Basics of Attention and Focus  
4. How Memory Works  
5. Imagination and Storytelling  
6. What are Feelings?  
7. Family and Friendship Dynamics  
8. Problem-Solving Basics  
9. Our Actions and Impact  
10. Teamwork and Cooperation  

**Curriculum Structure Rationale**  
The Grade 1 curriculum introduces children to the science of psychology by guiding them through how the mind works — how it thinks, feels, and acts. The ten-unit sequence follows the mind’s natural order of development: from understanding its basic framework, through information processing and creativity, to emotional awareness, self-regulation, and social collaboration.

Units 1–2 establish the foundation. *What is Psychology?* introduces the “Thinking–Feeling–Doing” model, helping children see the mind as a system that can be observed and described. *Exploring Our Senses* grounds this model in direct experience, showing how information enters through sight, sound, and touch — the first step in understanding how the mind gathers knowledge.

Units 3–5 explore how the mind manages and transforms information. *Attention and Focus* demonstrates how the mind chooses what to notice; *Memory* shows how experiences are stored and recalled; and *Imagination and Storytelling* extends this into creative thinking — using remembered ideas to build new ones and express understanding through stories.

Units 6–7 shift from cognition to emotion and relationships. *What are Feelings?* helps children recognise emotions as useful mental signals rather than random moods, while *Family and Friendship Dynamics* translates this awareness into understanding others — linking inner experiences with observable social patterns.

Units 8–10 integrate cognition, emotion, and behaviour into practical action. *Problem-Solving Basics* trains students to use thinking and feeling together when making choices; *Our Actions and Impact* encourages reflection on how behaviour affects others and the environment; and *Teamwork and Cooperation* completes the sequence by extending individual psychology into collective contexts — showing how minds work best together.

## Grade 2: Learning and Behaviour

**Focus:**  
Understanding how minds learn and change through experience (learning theories, information processing, memory strategies), how behaviour is shaped by observation and consequences (behaviorism, choice-making), and applying these principles to social contexts, rules, and emotional regulation.

**Unit Sequence**
1. How Do We Learn? (Introduction to learning theories)  
2. How Does Our Brain Process Information?  
3. Memory Tricks (Mnemonics)  
4. Observational Learning (Learning by Watching)  
5. Rewards and Consequences (Introduction to Behaviorism)  
6. How Do We Make Choices?  
7. Understanding Rules Through Games  
8. Social Behavior (Helping, Sharing, Group Dynamics)  
9. Differences and Similarities Between People  
10. The Science of Feelings  

**Curriculum Structure Rationale**  
The Grade 2 curriculum builds upon Grade 1's foundation by examining how minds learn, change, and adapt through experience. The ten-unit sequence progresses from individual learning mechanisms through behavioural principles to social applications, creating a bridge between internal mental processes and external actions.

Units 1–3 establish cognitive foundations. *How Do We Learn?* introduces students to the idea that learning can be studied through theories. *How Does Our Brain Process Information?* shows the mind as an active processor. *Memory Tricks* makes learning strategic and self-directed.

Units 4–5 introduce behavioural principles. *Observational Learning* extends understanding through imitation; *Rewards and Consequences* introduces motivation and habit formation.

Units 6–7 bridge cognition and behaviour through decision-making and systems. *How Do We Make Choices?* links thought and emotion; *Understanding Rules Through Games* helps children see rules as tools that guide behaviour.

Units 8–10 extend learning into social contexts — applying principles to cooperation, diversity, and emotion. *The Science of Feelings* closes the year by reframing emotions as learned, observable processes.

## Grade 3: Brain and Cognitive Development

**Focus:**  
Understanding the biological basis of mental processes (brain structure, perception, attention, memory), how practice physically changes the brain (neuroplasticity), and applying cognitive science to creativity, emotion, and collaboration.

**Unit Sequence**
1. What is the Brain? (Simplified Neuroscience)  
2. Perception: How Do We See, Hear, and Feel?  
3. Exploring Illusions (How Senses Can Trick Us)  
4. Attention: Our Brain's Spotlight  
5. Memory Experiments (Remembering Lists)  
6. Why Do We Forget? (Decay and Interference)  
7. How Practice Changes Your Brain  
8. Creative Thinking and Problem-Solving  
9. The Science of Emotions: Brain and Body  
10. Solving Problems Together: How Groups Think  

**Curriculum Structure Rationale**  
Grade 3 introduces biological foundations and cognitive mechanisms. It progresses from brain basics through perception and attention to memory and neuroplasticity, culminating in group cognition.

## Grade 4: Emotions and Social Psychology

**Focus:**  
Understanding complex emotions and their social origins (advanced emotions, empathy, peer influence), how groups function and cultures shape behavior, and applying social-emotional intelligence to cooperation and ethics.

**Unit Sequence**
1. Exploring Advanced Emotions (Jealousy, Pride)  
2. Social Roles: What Makes a Leader?  
3. Peer Pressure and How to Think Independently  
4. Empathy: Understanding Others’ Feelings  
5. How Do Groups Work Together?  
6. Building Trust and Cooperation in Teams  
7. Cultural Differences and Social Norms  
8. Stereotypes and Fairness  
9. Kindness Projects: Applying Psychology to Help Others  
10. Friendships and Changing Relationships  

**Curriculum Structure Rationale**  
Grade 4 explores the social mind — from complex emotions to cultural psychology — preparing students for mature social and ethical reasoning.

---

## Grade 5: Thinking, Problem-Solving, and Morality

**Focus:**  
Understanding abstract and logical reasoning (complex problem-solving, logical thinking), moral frameworks (fairness, justice, dilemmas), and applying higher-order thinking to decision-making, resilience, and collaboration.

**Unit Sequence**
1. How Do We Solve Complex Problems?  
2. Logical Thinking and Reasoning  
3. Exploring Fairness and Justice  
4. Moral Dilemmas: Right vs. Wrong  
5. The Role of Rules in Society  
6. How Do We Make Tough Choices?  
7. The Importance of Perspective-Taking  
8. Overcoming Challenges: Grit and Perseverance  
9. Creative Thinking in Groups  
10. Fun Experiments to Test Thinking (e.g., Stroop Test)  

**Curriculum Structure Rationale**  
Grade 5 develops abstract reasoning, ethics, and metacognition — connecting logical thinking, fairness, and resilience into applied cognitive growth.

---

## Grade 6: Advanced Topics in Psychology

**Focus:**  
Understanding individual differences and self-directed change (personality, habits, motivation), cognition under pressure (stress, memory, bias), and applying psychology to real-world contexts through critical thinking, regulation, and ethical problem-solving.

**Unit Sequence**
1. Introduction to Personality: What Makes Us Unique?  
2. Understanding Habits and How to Change Them  
3. Introduction to More Advanced Psychological Experiments  
4. Exploring Motivations: Why Do We Do What We Do?  
5. How Does Stress Affect the Brain?  
6. How Does Memory Work Under Pressure?  
7. Exploring Biases: Understanding Fairness  
8. Using Psychology in Daily Life (e.g., Persuasion)  
9. Introduction to Mindfulness and Self-Regulation  
10. Final Project: Applying Psychology to Solve a Real-World Problem  

**Curriculum Structure Rationale**  
Grade 6 serves as both culmination and transition — integrating all prior learning into self-awareness, scientific thinking, and applied psychology. By the end of Grade 6, students are psychologically literate citizens ready for advanced study and ethical application.
