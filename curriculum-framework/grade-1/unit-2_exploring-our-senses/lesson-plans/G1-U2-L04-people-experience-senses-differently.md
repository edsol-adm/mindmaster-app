## Lesson Objective
Students will recognise that people experience sensory input differently due to variations in sensitivity and preferences, will identify examples of sensory differences in themselves and classmates, and will demonstrate respect for differences by suggesting or accepting sensory accommodations.

## Warm-Up (5 min) – “The Preference Poll”

**Activity Steps**
1. Ask rapid-fire questions to the class:
   - “Hands up if you like bright lights. Hands up if you prefer dimmer light.”
   - “Who likes loud music? Who prefers quiet?”
   - “Who likes soft blankets? Who likes scratchy textures?”
2. Observe the variety of answers and say:
   > “Look—we all have different preferences! Some of us are more sensitive to sound. Some hardly notice it. This is normal.”
3. Frame: “Today we’re learning that being different with our senses is not a problem—it’s just how our minds work.”

**Materials:** none.

## Explore + Practice (30 min total)

### Part A – Sensory Differences Are Real and Normal (6 min)
- Show simple illustrations of sensory accommodations (e.g., glasses, hearing aids, noise-cancelling headphones, dimmer switches, fidget tools).
- Explain:
  - “Some people see very well without help. Some need glasses.”
  - “Some hear very softly. Some need hearing aids. Some are extra sensitive to noise.”
  - “Some love hugs. Others prefer space. All are okay.”
- Emphasise: “These are **differences**, not problems. Tools help people’s senses work better for them.”

**Psychology Insight:** This is part of “neurodiversity” — brains are wired differently, and that’s normal.

**Materials:** sensory accommodation cards or illustrations.

### Psychology Video (Sample Placeholder) (2 min)
**Title:** *Understanding Sensory Differences*  
**Link:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZItrTVqEVf4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZItrTVqEVf4)  
**Purpose:** Normalises sensory differences and shows examples in everyday life.  
**Usage Note:** This is a **sample reference only**. A final version will use original or properly licensed content.  
**Discussion:** “Did you notice how people in the video liked different things? That’s normal and okay.”

### Part B – Psychology Experiment (8 min) · “My Sensory Profile”
**Format:** MindMaster app (self-awareness activity)

**Steps**
1. Students see statements on screen and choose Agree / Disagree / Not sure.
2. Example statements:
   - “I like bright, colourful lights.”
   - “Loud noises bother me.”
   - “I like soft textures.”
   - “I prefer quiet when I’m working.”
   - “I like hugs.”
   - “Certain textures feel uncomfortable to me.”
3. Results show each student’s preferences privately.
4. Class reflection (optional): notice how answers are different.

**Key Insight:** Everyone has a unique sensory profile.

**Materials:** MindMaster app, clickers.

### Part C – Spotting Sensory Differences in Others (8 min)
- Present scenarios to the class:
  - Kai covers his ears during music time, Sara dances next to the speaker.  
  - Maya hates scratchy shirt tags, Leo doesn’t mind them.  
  - Zara avoids bright light, Ling loves it.  
  - Some kids love hugs, some prefer high-fives.
- Ask: “Why might they behave differently? Are they wrong? (No — they just sense things differently.)”
- Emphasise empathy and respect.

**Materials:** scenario cards or slides.

---

### MindMaster Game (6 min) · “Sensory Support Matching”
**Format:** Matching / Pairing  
Students match characters to helpful accommodations.

- **Example pairs:**  
  - Maya (sensitive to loud sound) → noise-cancelling headphones  
  - Zara (bright light) → dimmer light  
  - Leo (fidgeting) → fidget toy  
  - Priya (needs comfort) → soft blanket  
  - Sam (can’t see far) → glasses  
  - Kai (needs calm) → quiet space
- **Scoring:** 1 point per correct match. Timer: 3 min.

**Materials:** MindMaster app, clickers.

### MindMaster Quiz (5 min) · “Sensory Differences and Respect”
**Format:** Multiple choice & true/false.

**Sample Questions**
1. True or False: Everyone’s senses work exactly the same way. (False)  
2. Your friend says, “Your music is too loud.” What should you do? (turn it down)  
3. Some people need glasses. Does that mean their eyes are broken? (No)  
4. If a classmate doesn’t like to be touched, what should you do? (Respect their preference)  
5. Tools like hearing aids help people… (work better for them)  
6. If your friend covers their ears during loud sounds, what does that mean? (Their ears might be more sensitive)

**Feedback:** Immediate with short explanation.

**Materials:** MindMaster app, clickers.

## Reflection (5 min) – “Being a Good Sensory Friend”
**Discussion Prompt**
- “Everyone’s senses are different. What’s ONE way you can help a friend whose senses work differently from yours?”
  - A: Lower the volume
  - B: Let them sit where they’re comfortable
  - C: Respect if they don’t like to be touched
  - D: All of the above
- Students vote with clickers; display results.

Teacher reinforces:
> “Different is normal. Understanding these differences helps us care for each other.”

**Materials:** MindMaster app.

## Home Prep (5 min) – Preparing for MindMaster at Home
Explain:
> “Tonight, you’ll play **Sensory Detectives** at home. You’ll see pictures of people and think about how their senses might be different from yours.”

**Parent Instructions**
- Open MindMaster app → select “Lesson 4: Sensory Detectives”
- Child answers 7 questions (~5 min)
- Encourage family discussion about differences.

**Materials:** MindMaster app.

## Connection to Unit Arc
- **Lesson 1:** Introduced senses as doorways.  
- **Lesson 2:** Highlighted each sense’s unique role.  
- **Lesson 3:** Explored teamwork between senses.  
- **Lesson 4:** Emphasises that people experience senses differently.  
This builds empathy, respect, and understanding — key elements of **psychology literacy**.
