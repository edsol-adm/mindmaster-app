## Lesson Objective
Students will identify and describe how the mind **combines information from sight, sound, and touch** to create fuller understanding, and will demonstrate that using more than one sense makes tasks easier and clearer.

---

## Warm-Up (5 min) – “The Incomplete Detective”

**Activity Steps**
1. Teacher introduces: “I’m going to describe something using only ONE sense at a time. See if you can guess what it is.”
   - Sight only: show a picture of a puppy (no sound).
   - Sound only: play a barking sound (screen hidden).
   - Touch only: pass around a soft toy (eyes closed).
2. Ask: “Was it easy to guess with just one sense? What was confusing?”
3. Then reveal all senses together: sight + sound + touch. Ask: “Is it clearer now?”
4. Frame: “The mind is a team player. It listens to all doorways at once, putting the information together.”

**Materials:** image of a puppy, audio clip of barking, soft toy.

## Explore + Practice (30 min total)

### Part A – Senses Are Teammates (6 min)
- Draw or display a simple **“Team Senses” diagram**:
  - Three circles (SIGHT, SOUND, TOUCH) connecting to one central circle (THE MIND).
- Explain: “When your senses work together, they’re like a team giving the mind lots of different information at the same time. The mind mixes it all together—and that makes understanding stronger.”
- Give examples:
  - Eating lunch (see, hear crunch, feel texture)
  - Talking to a friend (see face, hear words, maybe touch hands)
  - Playing catch (see ball, hear movement, feel catch)

**Materials:** poster or whiteboard with diagram.

### Psychology Video (Sample Placeholder) (2 min)
**Title:** *Senses That Work Together*  
**Link:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UckGZfZ7PdI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UckGZfZ7PdI)  
**Purpose:** Explains how senses work together to make information clearer.  
**Usage Note:** This is a **sample reference only**. A final version will use original or properly licensed content.  
**Discussion:** “Did you see how using more than one sense makes it easier to understand things?”

### Part B – Psychology Experiment (8 min) · “The Multisensory Advantage Test”
**Steps**
1. One sense at a time:  
   - Show an object to one student (eyes only, 5 sec). Ask: “What can you describe?”  
   - Touch only for another student.  
   - Sound only (if applicable).  
2. All senses together for a third student: show, touch, sound.  
3. Compare: Which student gave the most complete description?
4. Group reflection: “Was it easier when we used more than one sense?”

**Key Insight:** Senses working together make understanding richer, faster, and clearer.

**Materials:** object with distinct visual, tactile, and (if possible) sound qualities (e.g., orange, fuzzy ball, toy with sound).

### Part C – Teamwork in Action (9 min) · Guided Observation
- Present real-life scenarios and ask students which senses are working together:
  - Watching a movie → sight + sound
  - Playing outside → sight + sound + touch
  - Talking to a friend → sight + sound + touch
  - Reading a book aloud → sight + sound
  - Building a sandcastle → sight + touch
- Ask follow-up:
  - “What happens if one team member is missing?”
  - Example: Watch a movie with the sound off. “Is it as good?”

**Materials:** printed or projected scenarios, observation worksheet.

---

### MindMaster Game (6 min) · “Build the Team”
**Format:** Sequence Builder  
Students arrange sensory events in the correct order for each activity to show how senses combine.

- **Setup:** Scenarios (e.g., making a sandwich). Four sensory event cards appear out of order.  
- **Examples of sequences:**
  - Making a sandwich: see bread → hear bag opening → feel bread → smell bread  
  - Playing with a friend: see friend → hear laugh → feel high-five  
  - Reading aloud: see → hear  
  - Going outside: see → hear → touch
- **Scoring:** Correct sequence = 3 points; partial = 1 point.

**Materials:** MindMaster app, clickers.

---

### MindMaster Quiz (5 min) · “Multisensory Advantage”
**Format:** Multiple choice, scenario-based.

**Sample Questions**
1. Which is easier: seeing your friend or seeing **and hearing** them?  
2. When your teacher reads a story, what helps you understand more? (hearing only / hearing + seeing)  
3. When you eat your favourite food, which gives the most enjoyment? (one sense / all senses together)  
4. What helps you catch a ball better? (just sight / sight + sound + touch)  
5. When your mind gets information from more than one sense, what happens? (it gets confused / it understands better)

**Feedback:** Immediate with explanation.

**Materials:** MindMaster app, clickers.

## Reflection (5 min) – “Two Senses Are Better Than One”
**Discussion Prompts**
- “Think about eating lunch today. Which senses did you use?”
- “Can you think of a time when using two senses together was better than one?”
- “What would be harder: watching a movie with no sound or hearing it with eyes closed?”

Teacher reinforces:
> “When senses work together, the mind gets more information and understands better.”

**Materials:** none.

## Home Prep (5 min) – Preparing for MindMaster at Home
Explain:
> “Tonight, you’ll play **Sense Team** at home. You’ll see pictures and questions about how senses work together.”

**Parent Instructions**
- Open MindMaster app → select “Lesson 3: Sense Team”
- Child answers 7 questions about multisensory scenarios (~5 min)
- Discuss: “When do your senses work best together?”

**Materials:** MindMaster app.

## Connection to Unit Arc
- **Lesson 1:** Introduced senses as doorways.  
- **Lesson 2:** Showed each sense has a unique role.  
- **Lesson 3:** Demonstrates **how senses work together**, building understanding.  
- **Lesson 4:** Will highlight how people experience senses differently.  
This lesson builds awareness of **multisensory integration** as a foundation for psychological understanding and empathy.
