## Lesson Objective
Students learn that **feelings are information signals** that communicate useful data about ourselves and our situations.  
They discover that feelings appear both in the **mind** (awareness) and the **body** (sensations), and that people can have different feelings about the same event.  
Students identify and name feelings, locate them in the body, and distinguish between **feelings as information** versus **feelings as instructions**.

## Warm-Up (5 min) – *“Message Delivery Game”*

**Steps**
1. Teacher pretends to be a messenger delivering notes:  
   “Message for the class! It’s almost recess!” → students react with excitement.  
   Then, “Message! We have to clean up first.” → different reactions.  
2. Ask: “How did those messages make you feel? Did your feelings give you information?”  
3. Connect: “Your body has messenger systems too! Your **Feeling** part sends messages about what’s happening. Today we’ll study how these messengers work.”

**Materials:** pretend message cards (or imaginary).

## Explore + Practice (30 min total)

### Part A – *Feelings as Information Signals* (10 min)

**Activity – “Messenger Jobs – What Feelings Tell Us”**
1. Introduce: “Feelings aren’t random; each feeling is a message telling you something useful.”  
2. Teach five core feeling-messages:

| Feeling | Information Message | Typical Example |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Fear / Scared** | “Warning – possible danger ahead.” | Crossing the street, big dog running toward you |
| **Sad** | “Something important is hurt or gone.” | Friend moved away, toy broke |
| **Angry** | “Something feels unfair or blocked.” | Someone cuts in line, sibling takes turn |
| **Happy / Excited** | “Something good is happening.” | Birthday party, success at task |
| **Worried / Nervous** | “I’m not sure what will happen.” | New situation, waiting for news |

3. **Interactive Sorting:** Teacher describes short situations; students identify which feeling fits.  
4. Key point: “All feelings give useful information — no feeling is bad; they’re all messengers trying to help you understand situations.”

**Materials:** “Feelings = Messages” chart (5 feelings + meanings).

### Psychology Video (2 min)

**Title:** *“Feelings in My Body – Where Do You Feel Your Emotions?”*  
**Link:** Search YouTube for “where do you feel emotions body kids” or “feelings in my body animation.”  
**Purpose:** Shows how different feelings create different body sensations.  
**Discussion:** “Did you know feelings happen in your body too, not just your mind?”  

**Materials:** video projection.

---

### Part B – *Psychology Experiment – Body Mapping Test (MindMaster)* (10 min)

Demonstrates that feelings create **real, physical sensations** that can be observed and located.

**Game Flow**
1. Screen shows outline of a child’s body with five zones (1 Head  2 Chest/Heart  3 Stomach  4 Arms/Hands  5 Legs).  
2. Teacher reads scenarios; students click where they feel it.  
3. **Sample Scenarios**  
   - “Imagine you’re about to go on stage.” → most choose Stomach or Chest.  
   - “Someone gives you a big hug.” → Chest.  
   - “You’re running and about to win the race.” → Legs and Chest.  
   - “You see a spider crawling toward you.” → Stomach or Head.  
4. App shows class results as heat map.  
5. Discuss: “Scientists discovered patterns like these — feelings use our bodies to send signals. They’re physical!”

**Scoring:** none; focus on pattern recognition.  
**Materials:** MindMaster app; student clickers.

### Part C – *MindMaster Game – “Feelings Detective”* (10 min)

**Format:** Match Character to Scenario (image-based).  
**Flow**

## Reflection (5 min) – *MindMaster Quick Poll: ‘My Messenger Now’*

**Steps**
1. Display three poll questions (one at a time):

2. Show anonymous class graphs.  
3. Discuss: “Same classroom, different feelings — that’s normal! Everyone’s Messenger works for them.”  
4. Debrief: “You just observed your feelings scientifically — noticing, locating, understanding their message. That’s what mind scientists do!”

## Connection to Unit Arc
This lesson deepens the scientific study of **Feeling (the Messenger)** introduced in Lesson 1.  
Students now understand two mind parts — **Thinking** and **Feeling** — as observable systems that exchange information.  
Lesson 4 will complete the framework with **Doing (the Action Player)**, showing how thinking and feeling guide actions to make the mind visible.
