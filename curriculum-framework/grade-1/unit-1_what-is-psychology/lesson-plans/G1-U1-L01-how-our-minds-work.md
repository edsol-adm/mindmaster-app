## Lesson Objective
Students will learn that **psychology** is the scientific study of how minds work, and that every mind has three observable parts:

- **Thinking (“Idea Factory”)** – making ideas and plans  
- **Feeling (“Messenger”)** – emotions and body sensations  
- **Doing (“Action Player”)** – actions others can see  

Students identify these three parts in everyday scenarios and explain how they work together.

## Warm-Up (5 min) – “ What Can Scientists Study? ”

**Activity Steps**
1. Ask: “What do scientists study?” (animals, plants, weather, space …)  
2. Show images of different scientists at work (biologist / microscope, astronomer / telescope).  
3. Reveal: “Today we become **Mind Scientists!** We’ll study something you carry everywhere—your mind!”  
4. Quick poll: “Can you see your mind? Can you touch it?” (No → but we can observe what it does.)  
5. Establish: scientists study things by **observing carefully**, even when they can’t see them directly.

**Materials:** images of scientists (hard copy or projected)

## Explore + Practice (30 min total)

### Part A – Discovering the Three Parts (12 min) · “Inside the Mind Machine”
- Present the mind as a system with three jobs using simple metaphors:

  | Mind Part | Metaphor / Function |
  |------------|---------------------|
  | **THINKING** | “Idea Factory” – makes plans, solves problems, remembers, imagines |
  | **FEELING** | “Messenger” – sends information through emotions & body signals |
  | **DOING** | “Action Player” – makes movements, words, faces that others see |

- **Demonstration:**  
  Teacher acts out scenario:  
  > “I’m looking at the clock (show looking). My Idea Factory thinks ‘almost lunch time.’  
  > My Messenger sends a hungry feeling in my stomach.  
  > My Action Player makes me stand up and walk to my lunch bag.”  
  Students identify each part as you narrate.

**Materials:** three large labeled cards (THINKING / FEELING / DOING)

### Psychology Video (3 min)
**Title:** *Inside Out – Riley’s First Day of School (clip)*  
**Link:** Search YouTube for “Inside Out Riley first day school clip” (0–3 min).  
**Purpose:** visual representation of inner mental processes (thoughts / emotions) leading to observable behavior.  
**Discussion:**  
“What was Riley’s Idea Factory thinking? What did her Messenger feel? What did her Action Player do?”

**Materials:** video projection.

### Part B – Psychology Experiment (8 min) · “The Stop-and-Think Test”
This simple in-class experiment shows how the three parts work together and lets children observe their own mental processes.

**Steps**
1. Students stand in a circle; teacher holds up different colored cards (red, blue, green).  
2. **Round 1 – Automatic:** “When you see BLUE, clap once immediately.” (show cards randomly).  
3. **Round 2 – Think First:** “When you see BLUE, STOP and count to 3 in your Idea Factory before clapping.”  
4. Discuss: “Was Round 2 harder? Why?”  
   - *Messenger* felt the urge to clap (automatic feeling).  
   - *Idea Factory* thought “wait, count first.”  
   - *Action Player* followed the new plan.  
   → All three parts worked together!

**Materials:** colored cards.

### Part C – MindMaster Game (7 min) · “Sort the Mind Parts”
**Format:** Sorting game (10 scenarios).  
Students see simple situations and choose whether the example shows **Thinking**, **Feeling**, or **Doing**.

**Sample Questions (10 total)**
- “Making a plan for building a tower” → THINKING  
- “Your heart beating fast” → FEELING  
- “Waving goodbye to a friend” → DOING  
- “Remembering what you ate yesterday” → THINKING  
- “Feeling butterflies in your tummy” → FEELING  
- “Walking to the door” → DOING  
- “Wondering what will happen next” → THINKING  
- “A warm, happy feeling in your chest” → FEELING  
- “Saying ‘thank you’ out loud” → DOING  
- “Imagining a rainbow-colored cat” → THINKING  

**Feedback:** “Correct! [Mind part] happens [in your head / body / where others can see it].”  
**Scoring:** 1 point per correct answer; show individual and class average.  
**Goal:** 7 + correct answers → students can identify all three mind parts.

**Materials:** MindMaster app, student clickers

## Reflection (5 min) – “My Mind Right Now”
Students draw three quick sketches on a sheet divided into three sections:

1. “My Idea Factory is thinking about …”  
2. “My Messenger is feeling …”  
3. “My Action Player just did …”

2–3 volunteers share one part with the class.  
Teacher reinforces:  
> “You just observed your own minds like scientists! All three parts are always working.”  

**Materials:** paper (divided in thirds), pencils/crayons (hard copy).

## Home Prep (5 min) – Preparing for MindMaster at Home
Explain:  
> “At home, you’ll play **Mind Detective** on MindMaster.  
> You’ll watch short videos of people doing things and guess what their three mind parts might be doing.”

Show the app interface briefly on screen.  
Instructions:  
“Watch carefully – what might the person be thinking? Feeling? What are they doing that you CAN see?”  
Emphasize:  
“You can always see doing, but thinking and feeling are invisible—so you make scientific guesses based on clues!”  

**Materials:** MindMaster app demonstration

## Connection to Unit Arc
This foundational lesson introduces the **three-part framework** that will structure all subsequent learning.  
Lesson 2 will zoom in on **THINKING (the Idea Factory)**, exploring its many jobs.  
Understanding these three parts as separate but connected gives students the vocabulary and conceptual structure for analysing mental experiences throughout the unit.
