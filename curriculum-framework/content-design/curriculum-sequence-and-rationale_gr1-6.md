## Grade 1: Introduction to Psychology

**Focus:**  
Understanding how minds work (thinking, feeling, doing), information processing (senses, attention, memory, imagination), and applying psychological knowledge to relationships, problem-solving, and collaboration.

**Unit Sequence**
1. What is Psychology?  
2. Exploring Our Senses (Sight, Sound, Touch)  
3. Basics of Attention and Focus  
4. How Memory Works  
5. Imagination and Storytelling  
6. What are Feelings?  
7. Family and Friendship Dynamics  
8. Problem-Solving Basics  
9. Our Actions and Impact  
10. Teamwork and Cooperation  

**Curriculum Structure Rationale**  

The Grade 1 curriculum introduces children to the science of psychology by guiding them through how the mind works — how it thinks, feels, and acts. The ten-unit sequence follows the mind’s natural order of development: from understanding its basic framework, through information processing and creativity, to emotional awareness, self-regulation, and social collaboration.

• **Units 1–2** establish the foundation. *What is Psychology?* introduces the “Thinking–Feeling–Doing” model, helping children see the mind as a system that can be observed and described. *Exploring Our Senses* grounds this model in direct experience, showing how information enters through sight, sound, and touch — the first step in understanding how the mind gathers knowledge.  

• **Units 3–5** explore how the mind manages and transforms information. *Attention and Focus* demonstrates how the mind chooses what to notice; *Memory* shows how experiences are stored and recalled; and *Imagination and Storytelling* extends this into creative thinking — using remembered ideas to build new ones and express understanding through stories.  

• **Units 6–7** shift from cognition to emotion and relationships. *What are Feelings?* helps children recognise emotions as useful mental signals rather than random moods, while *Family and Friendship Dynamics* translates this awareness into understanding others — linking inner experiences with observable social patterns.  

• **Units 8–10** integrate cognition, emotion, and behaviour into practical action. *Problem-Solving Basics* trains students to use thinking and feeling together when making choices; *Our Actions and Impact* encourages reflection on how behaviour affects others and the environment; and *Teamwork and Cooperation* completes the sequence by extending individual psychology into collective contexts — showing how minds work best together.  

Overall, the structure mirrors a coherent psychological journey: from seeing how the mind works → understanding its processes → applying them to self and others. By the end of Grade 1, students not only know what psychology is but begin to live it — observing, explaining, and improving how they think, feel, and act in the world around them.

## Grade 2: Learning and Behaviour

**Focus:**  
Understanding how minds learn and change through experience (learning theories, information processing, memory strategies), how behaviour is shaped by observation and consequences (behaviorism, choice-making), and applying these principles to social contexts, rules, and emotional regulation.

**Unit Sequence**
1. How Do We Learn? (Introduction to learning theories)  
2. How Does Our Brain Process Information?  
3. Memory Tricks (Mnemonics)  
4. Observational Learning (Learning by Watching)  
5. Rewards and Consequences (Introduction to Behaviorism)  
6. How Do We Make Choices?  
7. Understanding Rules Through Games  
8. Social Behavior (Helping, Sharing, Group Dynamics)  
9. Differences and Similarities Between People  
10. The Science of Feelings  

**Curriculum Structure Rationale**  

The Grade 2 curriculum builds upon Grade 1's foundational understanding by examining how minds learn, change, and adapt through experience. The ten-unit sequence progresses from individual learning mechanisms through behavioural principles to social applications, creating a bridge between internal mental processes and external actions.

• **Units 1–3** establish the cognitive foundations of learning. *How Do We Learn?* introduces students to the idea that learning itself can be studied and understood through different theories. *How Does Our Brain Process Information?* reveals the mind as an active processor that transforms incoming data into knowledge. *Memory Tricks* applies this understanding practically, showing students that they can use strategies to enhance their own learning—empowering them as active learners rather than passive recipients.  

• **Units 4–5** introduce behavioural principles and their mechanisms. *Observational Learning* expands students' view of learning beyond personal experience to include what they absorb from watching others—a crucial insight for understanding social development. *Rewards and Consequences* introduces behaviorism's core concepts, helping children recognize how outcomes shape behaviour and providing them with tools to understand motivation and habit formation.  

• **Units 6–7** bridge cognition and behaviour through decision-making frameworks. *How Do We Make Choices?* synthesizes thinking and feeling with behavioural outcomes, while *Understanding Rules Through Games* makes abstract concepts concrete by exploring how structured systems guide behaviour—preparing students to see rules as psychological tools rather than arbitrary restrictions.  

• **Units 8–10** extend learning principles into social contexts. *Social Behavior* applies observational learning and reward concepts to helping, sharing, and group dynamics. *Differences and Similarities Between People* acknowledges individual variation while building appreciation for human commonality. *The Science of Feelings* completes the sequence by revisiting emotions with new sophistication—now understood not just as internal experiences but as learned responses that can be observed, understood, and regulated.  

Overall, the structure moves from understanding learning mechanisms → recognizing behavioural patterns → applying principles socially. By Grade 2's end, students see themselves as learners who can shape their own development and understand how behaviour emerges from the interaction of mind, environment, and social context.

## Grade 3: Brain and Cognitive Development

**Focus:**  
Understanding the biological basis of mental processes (brain structure, perception, attention, memory), how practice physically changes the brain (neuroplasticity), and applying cognitive science to creativity, emotion, and collaboration.

**Unit Sequence**
1. What is the Brain? (Simplified Neuroscience)  
2. Perception: How Do We See, Hear, and Feel?  
3. Exploring Illusions (How Senses Can Trick Us)  
4. Attention: Our Brain's Spotlight  
5. Memory Experiments (Remembering Lists)  
6. Why Do We Forget? (Decay and Interference)  
7. How Practice Changes Your Brain  
8. Creative Thinking and Problem-Solving  
9. The Science of Emotions: Brain and Body  
10. Solving Problems Together: How Groups Think  

**Curriculum Structure Rationale**  

The Grade 3 curriculum introduces biological foundations while deepening cognitive understanding. The sequence moves from brain basics through perceptual and attentional processes to memory systems, culminating in how mental practice creates physical change and enables collaborative thinking.

• **Units 1–3** ground psychology in neuroscience. *What is the Brain?* introduces the physical organ that enables all mental processes, making the abstract concrete. *Perception* reveals how sensory information becomes meaningful experience through active brain processes. *Exploring Illusions* turns this understanding playful and profound—showing that perception is constructed rather than passively received, fostering critical thinking about subjective experience versus objective reality.  

• **Units 4–6** examine core cognitive processes with increasing depth. *Attention: Our Brain's Spotlight* revisits Grade 1's focus concept with new sophistication, explaining selective attention as a limited resource that requires management. *Memory Experiments* makes memory investigation hands-on, transforming students into junior researchers. *Why Do We Forget?* introduces interference and decay, normalizing forgetting as a natural process while explaining its mechanisms.  

• **Unit 7** provides a pivotal connection: *How Practice Changes Your Brain* introduces neuroplasticity—the revolutionary insight that mental activity physically reshapes neural structures. This transforms learning from mysterious to mechanistic, empowering students with the understanding that effort literally builds cognitive capacity.  

• **Units 8–10** apply cognitive principles to real-world challenges. *Creative Thinking and Problem-Solving* extends memory and attention into generative thinking. *The Science of Emotions: Brain and Body* revisits feelings with biological grounding, linking emotional experience to neural and physiological processes. *Solving Problems Together* synthesizes individual cognition into collective intelligence, showing how groups combine diverse cognitive resources to achieve what individuals cannot alone.  

The structure progresses from biological foundations → cognitive mechanisms → neuroplasticity → applied collective cognition. By Grade 3's end, students understand minds as physical, changeable systems that grow through use and work synergistically in groups.

**Curriculum Structure Rationale**  

The Grade 4 curriculum shifts focus from individual cognition to the social mind, exploring how emotions, relationships, and cultural contexts shape psychological experience. The sequence progresses from complex individual emotions through social dynamics to cultural awareness, preparing students to navigate increasingly sophisticated social environments.

• **Units 1–2** explore advanced emotional and social territory. *Exploring Advanced Emotions* moves beyond basic feelings to complex states like jealousy and pride—emotions that require social comparison and self-awareness. *Social Roles: What Makes a Leader?* introduces role psychology, showing how situations and expectations shape behaviour differently from personality alone, fostering flexibility in how students understand themselves and others.  

• **Units 3–4** develop critical social-cognitive skills. *Peer Pressure and How to Think Independently* addresses a crucial developmental challenge, giving students frameworks to recognize social influence while maintaining autonomy. *Empathy: Understanding Others' Feelings* builds perspective-taking capacity, essential for mature social functioning and the foundation for moral reasoning.  

• **Units 5–6** examine group psychology and cooperation. *How Do Groups Work Together?* analyzes collective behaviour patterns, helping students understand dynamics they experience daily. *Building Trust and Cooperation in Teams* applies this knowledge practically, teaching collaboration as a psychological skill requiring specific practices rather than just goodwill.  

• **Units 7–8** introduce cultural psychology and social cognition challenges. *Cultural Differences and Social Norms* broadens students' psychological frameworks beyond their immediate context, fostering cultural humility. *Stereotypes and Fairness* confronts cognitive biases directly, introducing students to how mental shortcuts can produce unfair judgments—crucial for developing ethical reasoning.  

• **Units 9–10** integrate learning through application and reflection. *Kindness Projects* transforms psychological knowledge into prosocial action, reinforcing that psychology serves human flourishing. *Friendships and Changing Relationships* acknowledges developmental transitions students face, normalizing relationship evolution while providing tools to navigate change.  

The structure moves from complex individual psychology → social influence and empathy → group dynamics → cultural awareness → applied prosocial psychology. By Grade 4's end, students possess sophisticated social-emotional intelligence and recognize psychology as culturally embedded.
