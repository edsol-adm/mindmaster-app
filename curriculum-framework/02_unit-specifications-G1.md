<td>Unit 1: What is Psychology?</td>
<td><p>This foundational unit introduces students to the mind as an interconnected system with three essential parts: Thinking (the "Idea Factory" for planning, problem-solving, and imagining), Feeling (the "Messenger" providing information through emotions and body sensations), and Doing (the "Action Player" making our inner world visible through observable actions). Students learn that everyone has a mind with these same three parts, though they work together differently in different situations.</p>
<p>Through concrete daily-life examples, sorting activities, and observation exercises, children identify and label these three parts in themselves and others. They practice distinguishing between private mental experiences (thinking and feeling happen inside, invisible to others) and observable actions (doing is what others see). Role-play and cause-and-effect scenarios help students describe how the parts influence one another using simple language: "I thought about..., then I felt..., so I did..."</p>
<p>The three-part model establishes psychology's foundational framework—that mental processes can be observed, categorized, and understood systematically. This introduces age-appropriate metacognition (thinking about thinking) by making abstract internal experiences concrete through metaphor and observable examples, providing the organizing structure for understanding all future psychology concepts.</p>
<p>By framing the mind as an understandable system rather than a mysterious black box, students develop foundational psychological literacy and self-efficacy ("I can understand how my mind works"). The shared vocabulary enables both self-awareness and empathy, supporting children to discuss mental experiences that will underpin learning about attention, memory, emotions, relationships, and problem-solving throughout the curriculum.</p></td>
<td><p><strong>By the end of this unit, students will be able to:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Define</strong> psychology as the study of how minds work and <strong>explain</strong> that everyone has a mind with three parts: Thinking, Feeling, and Doing</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Identify and label</strong> examples of thinking (Idea Factory), feeling (Messenger), and doing (Action Player) in everyday scenarios from their own lives or observations of others</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Distinguish</strong> between private mental experiences (thinking and feeling) and observable actions (doing) by categorizing given examples as "inside my mind" or "others can see"</p></li>

<td>Lesson 1: How Our Minds Work</td>
<td><p><strong>Lesson 1: How Our Minds Work</strong></p>
<p>This lesson introduces the mind as a system with three interconnected parts: <strong>Thinking</strong> (making ideas, solving problems, planning), <strong>Feeling</strong> (emotions and body sensations that give us information), and <strong>Doing</strong> (actions our bodies take).</p>
<p>Through concrete examples from daily life, children explore how these parts work together and influence each other. They learn to identify which parts are active in different situations and recognize that everyone's mind has these same three parts. The lesson emphasizes observation and curiosity—children become "mind scientists" noticing how their minds (and others' minds) work in action.</p>
<p>This foundational framework provides the organizing structure for understanding all future psychology concepts and gives children a shared language for discussing mental experiences.</p></td>
<td><p><strong>By the end of Lesson 1, students will be able to:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Identify</strong> the three parts of the mind—Thinking, Feeling, and Doing—and give one example of each from daily life.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recognize</strong> which part of the mind is active in common scenarios (e.g., correctly sorting situation cards or identifying that "planning a game" is Thinking).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Explain</strong> how the three parts work together in a specific situation (e.g., "I felt scared, thought the dog might jump, so I stepped back").</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Describe</strong> the three parts of the mind at work in another person during an observed activity or role-play.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Apply</strong> the mind framework to analyze a recent personal experience, identifying where Thinking, Feeling, and Doing each occurred.</p></li>

<td>Lesson 2: Thinking - Our Mind's Idea Factory</td>
<td><p><strong>Lesson 2: Thinking - Our Mind's Idea Factory</strong></p>
<p>This lesson explores the <strong>Thinking</strong> part of the mind in depth, teaching children that thinking includes many different jobs: remembering, imagining, planning, solving problems, wondering, and making decisions. Children learn that their "Idea Factory" is constantly working—even when they're quiet or sitting still—and that thinking happens privately inside their heads where others can't see it.</p>
<p>Through hands-on activities, children discover that they can use their Idea Factory deliberately to help them in everyday situations: generating multiple solutions to problems, thinking before acting, remembering important information, and imagining possibilities. They also learn that everyone's Idea Factory works a bit differently—some people think in pictures, some in words, some need quiet to think, others think better with movement.</p>
<p>The lesson emphasizes that thinking is a tool children can learn to use more skillfully, and that noticing when and how they're thinking helps them make better choices and understand others better.</p></td>
<td><p><strong>By the end of Lesson 2, students will be able to:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Identify</strong> at least three different types of thinking their Idea Factory does (e.g., remembering, imagining, planning, problem-solving, wondering, deciding) and give an example of each from their own experience.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Explain</strong> that thinking happens privately inside our heads where others cannot see it, even when our bodies are still or quiet.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Apply</strong> deliberate thinking to solve a simple problem by generating multiple possible solutions before choosing one (e.g., "What could I do if I forgot my lunch?").</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recognize</strong> that different people's Idea Factories work in different ways (e.g., thinking in pictures vs. words, needing quiet vs. movement) by observing and describing examples from themselves and classmates.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Demonstrate</strong> the practice of "thinking before acting" by pausing to use their Idea Factory in a scenario and explaining what they thought about before deciding what to do.</p></li>

<td>Lesson 3: Feeling - Our Mind's Messenger</td>
<td><p><strong>Lesson 3: Feeling - Our Mind's Messenger</strong></p>
<p>This lesson explores the <strong>Feeling</strong> part of the mind, teaching children that feelings are information messengers that tell us important things about ourselves and our situations. Children learn that feelings aren't just "good" or "bad"—they all serve useful purposes: fear warns us about possible danger, sadness tells us something matters to us, anger signals something feels unfair, excitement tells us something good is happening.</p>
<p>Through concrete activities, children discover that feelings show up in two places: in their <strong>minds</strong> (knowing "I feel happy") and in their <strong>bodies</strong> (butterflies in stomach, warmth in chest, tight shoulders). They learn to identify different feelings, notice where they feel them physically, and understand that the same situation can create different feelings in different people.</p>
<p>The lesson emphasizes that feelings are normal, everyone has them, and they give us valuable information—but feelings are messages to notice and understand, not instructions we must follow. Children begin to see how feelings connect to the other mind parts: feelings can spark thinking, and thinking can help us understand what our feeling-messengers are telling us.</p></td>
<td><p><strong>By the end of Lesson 3, students will be able to:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Identify</strong> at least four different feelings by name and describe what information each one communicates (e.g., "Fear warns me about danger" or "Sadness tells me something important to me is gone or hurt").</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Locate</strong> where specific feelings appear in their body (e.g., pointing to stomach for nervous, chest for excited, or shoulders for worried).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Distinguish</strong> between a feeling as information and a feeling as an instruction (e.g., "I feel angry, which tells me something seems unfair, but I can choose what to do about it").</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recognize</strong> that the same situation can create different feelings in different people and provide an example (e.g., "The loud assembly made me feel excited but made my friend feel overwhelmed").</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Explain</strong> how feelings connect to thinking and doing in a specific scenario (e.g., "My body felt nervous, then I thought about why, and I realized I was worried about the test").</p></li>
</ol></td>

<tr class="odd">
<td>Lesson 4: Doing - Our Mind's Action Player</td>
<td><p><strong>Lesson 4: Doing - Our Mind's Action Player</strong></p>
<p>This lesson explores the <strong>Doing</strong> part of the mind, teaching children that actions are what make our inner world (thinking and feeling) visible to others. Children learn that their "Action Player" includes everything observable: speaking, moving, facial expressions, gestures, and choices about what to do or not do.</p>
<p>Through concrete activities, children discover how Thinking and Feeling guide their Action Player in different ways. They explore real-life scenarios showing various pathways: sometimes a strong feeling leads directly to quick action, sometimes thinking plans an action carefully, and sometimes thinking and feeling work together to choose an action. Children learn that while they can't always control what they think or feel, they have the most control over their doing—and that this control grows with practice.</p>
<p>The lesson emphasizes that actions have effects on ourselves and others, that we can pause between feeling/thinking and doing, and that observing others' actions helps us understand what might be happening in their minds. This integrates all three components, showing children how their minds work as a complete system.</p></td>
<td><p><strong>By the end of Lesson 4, students will be able to:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Identify</strong> at least four types of observable actions their Action Player produces (e.g., speaking, facial expressions, body movements, or choosing to wait).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Explain</strong> how thinking and feeling each guide actions using specific examples (e.g., "My feeling of anger made me want to yell, but my thinking helped me choose to walk away" or "I felt excited and immediately ran to tell my friend").</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Distinguish</strong> between actions they can control and thoughts or feelings they cannot control (e.g., "I can't stop feeling nervous, but I can choose whether to try the hard problem").</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Demonstrate</strong> the pause between thinking/feeling and doing by describing or showing a moment where they noticed an urge and chose a different action.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Infer</strong> what someone else might be thinking or feeling based on their observable actions (e.g., "When she crossed her arms and turned away, she might have been feeling angry or hurt").</p></li>

<td>Unit 2: What are Feelings?</td>
<td><p>Building on the foundational three-part mind model, this unit provides an in-depth exploration of feelings as information systems. Students learn that feelings are valuable messengers carrying important information about themselves and their situations, not random experiences to judge as "good" or "bad."</p>
<p>Through four progressive lessons, children discover that feelings manifest in both mind and body (recognizing physical sensations like butterflies or tight shoulders), that feelings are temporary and naturally change over time (building hope and resilience), and that while all people experience feelings, expressions vary across individuals and cultures.</p>
<p>The unit emphasizes observation and curiosity—students learn to notice feelings in themselves and wonder about others' inner experiences—fostering both self-awareness and empathy. This deepened understanding of emotional experiences as understandable, temporary, and universal phenomena equips students with psychological literacy that supports self-efficacy and mental resilience.</p></td>
<td><p><strong>By the end of this unit, students will be able to:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Identify and name</strong> a range of common feelings (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, excitement, surprise) in themselves and others, recognizing that all feelings are natural parts of human experience.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Describe</strong> how feelings manifest in both mind (knowing "I feel scared") and body (butterflies in stomach, tight shoulders, racing heart), locating where specific feelings appear in their own physical experience.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Explain</strong> that feelings function as information messengers carrying useful signals about situations (e.g., "fear warns me to be careful," "sadness tells me something matters to me"), rather than instructions that must be followed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recognize</strong> that the same situation can create different feelings in different people, and that both the universality of feelings and the diversity of emotional expression are normal patterns in how minds work.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Apply</strong> body awareness as an observational tool to notice and name their feelings in everyday situations, using physical sensations as early indicators of emotional states.</p></li>

<td>Lesson 1: Different Feelings and What They Tell Us</td>
<td><p><strong>Lesson 1: Different Feelings and What They Tell Us</strong></p>
<p>This lesson introduces children to the wide variety of feelings humans experience and the idea that each feeling carries a message. Feelings are not random or meaningless—they are like messengers that tell us something important about ourselves and our situations. Happiness might signal that something is enjoyable or valuable, sadness may show that we’ve lost something we care about, anger can signal that something feels unfair, and nervousness may warn us to be cautious or prepared.</p>
<p>Through interactive examples and classroom activities, children learn to identify and name common feelings, notice how different feelings show up in everyday life, and explore the useful messages feelings can bring. They begin to understand that while some feelings are comfortable and others uncomfortable, all feelings serve a purpose. The same event can bring out different feelings in different people, and that’s normal.</p>
<p>The lesson emphasizes that feelings are valuable sources of information, not “good” or “bad” instructions to follow. This helps children build curiosity about their inner experiences, laying the foundation for treating emotions as part of a larger psychology framework—something that can be understood, observed, and used to make sense of life.</p></td>
<td><p><strong>By the end of Lesson 1, students will be able to:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Identify</strong> at least four common feelings (happy, sad, angry, scared, excited) using words or pictures.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Describe</strong> what information each feeling communicates (e.g., "Fear warns me about danger" or "Sadness tells me something important to me is gone or hurt").</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Distinguish</strong> between comfortable and uncomfortable feelings without judging them as "good" or "bad" (e.g., recognizing that anger feels uncomfortable but isn't wrong).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recognize</strong> that the same event can create different feelings for different people, sharing one example from class discussion.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Apply</strong> curiosity by asking "What might this feeling be telling me?" in simple reflection activities.</p></li>

<td>Lesson 2: How Feelings Show Up in Our Bodies</td>
<td><p><strong>Lesson 2: How Feelings Show Up in Our Bodies</strong></p>
<p>This lesson helps children understand that feelings are not only in the mind but also show up in the body. Emotions create physical signals—our bodies often react before we even find the words to describe what we feel. For example, worry might bring a tight stomach, anger might bring clenched fists, and happiness might bring a light, bouncy energy. These body signals are part of how feelings send us messages, helping us notice and respond to what is happening inside and around us.</p>
<p>Through guided activities, students practice identifying where and how different feelings appear in their bodies. They discover that while many people share common physical cues, each person’s body signals can also be unique. The lesson emphasizes that paying attention to body signals is a powerful tool: noticing these cues can help us recognize our feelings early and understand them better. This strengthens children’s ability to tune into themselves and builds awareness that mind and body work together.</p></td>
<td><p><strong>By the end of Lesson 2, students will be able to:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Locate</strong> where specific feelings appear in their body by pointing to or naming the physical location (e.g., butterflies in stomach for nervous, warmth in chest for happy).</p></li>
</ol>

<td>Lesson 3: Feelings Change (And That's Normal)</td>
<td><p><strong>Lesson 3: Feelings Change (And That's Normal)</strong></p>
<p>This lesson introduces the idea that feelings are not fixed—they shift and change over time. Just as the weather can move from sunny to rainy and back again, our feelings can rise, fade, or transform depending on what is happening around us and inside us. Children learn that it is normal for feelings to be temporary and that even strong or uncomfortable feelings will not last forever.</p>
<p>Through stories and simple activities, students explore examples of how feelings can change in different situations: excitement may turn into disappointment, sadness may ease when comforted, or nervousness may settle once a task begins. They also discover that people may move through feelings at different speeds—some quickly, others more slowly—and both are normal. The lesson emphasizes that noticing feelings change gives us hope and perspective: tricky feelings can pass, and new feelings will always come. This awareness helps children build resilience by understanding feelings as moving experiences rather than permanent states.</p></td>
<td><p><strong>By the end of Lesson 3, students will be able to:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Explain</strong> that feelings are temporary and change over time, using weather as a concrete analogy (e.g., "Feelings can move from sad to calm, like weather from rainy to sunny").</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Identify</strong> examples of how feelings changed in a story or personal experience (e.g., "I felt nervous before the assembly, then excited during it, then tired after").</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recognize</strong> that people move through feelings at different speeds—some quickly, others more slowly—and both patterns are normal.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Apply</strong> the understanding that uncomfortable feelings will pass by recalling a time when a difficult feeling eventually changed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Describe</strong> what helps feelings change (e.g., time passing, comfort from others, situation changing, body calming down).</p></li>

<td>Lesson 4: Everyone Has Feelings (Even When They Look Different)</td>
<td><p><strong>Lesson 4: Everyone Has Feelings (Even When They Look Different)</strong></p>
<p>This lesson highlights that all people experience feelings, but the way they show or express them can look different. Some children may laugh when they feel nervous, others may go quiet when they are sad, and some may show anger with loud words while others keep it inside. Feelings are universal, but expressions are personal.</p>
<p>Through stories, role-play, and observation, children explore how the same feeling can appear in different ways depending on the person, the situation, or the culture. They learn to look beyond surface behavior and practice curiosity: “What might that person be feeling?” This builds empathy and helps children understand that while feelings are shared human experiences, people may not always show them in the same way.</p>
<p>The lesson emphasizes that recognizing the universality of feelings fosters connection—we all have them—while respecting differences in expression encourages kindness and patience. Children begin to see that understanding others’ feelings is a key part of living and learning together.</p></td>
<td><p><strong>By the end of Lesson 4, students will be able to:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Recognize</strong> that all people experience feelings, even when their expressions look different.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Distinguish</strong> between internal feelings (universal) and external expressions (varied) by providing examples (e.g., "Some people cry when sad; others go quiet").</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Identify</strong> at least two different ways the same feeling might be expressed by different people or in different cultures.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Apply</strong> curiosity by asking "What might that person be feeling?" when observing behavior rather than assuming they know.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Demonstrate</strong> empathy by acknowledging that classmates' different expressions of feelings are all valid ways of experiencing emotions.</p></li>

<td>Unit 3: Exploring Our Senses (Sight, Sound, Touch)</td>
<td><p>This unit introduces sensation as the foundational process connecting the external world to the mind's internal workings. Students learn that the senses function as "doorways" or information-gathering systems, each providing unique types of data—sight delivers colors and shapes, sound brings voices and signals, touch conveys textures and temperatures.</p>
<p>Through four progressive lessons, children discover how each sense contributes its own specialized information, how senses typically work as a team to create fuller understanding (multisensory integration makes experiences clearer and safer), and that people experience sensory input differently based on individual variations in sensitivity, preferences, and needs.</p>
<p>The unit emphasizes observation and empathy: students become "sense detectives" exploring their own sensory experiences while recognizing that classmates may perceive the same situations differently, and that tools or accommodations help everyone's senses work effectively.</p>
<p>By framing sensation as the mind's data collection system, this unit reinforces psychology as the science of how internal mental processes (thinking, feeling, doing) connect with and respond to external reality, building both self-awareness and understanding of others.</p></td>

<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Identify</strong> the three main senses—sight, sound, and touch—and <strong>match</strong> each to the type of information it gathers (e.g., sight → colors/shapes, sound → voices/noises, touch → textures/temperature).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Describe</strong> how each sense helps the mind notice and learn about the world, using <strong>simple real-life examples</strong> (e.g., “My eyes help me find my shoes”; “My ears tell me when my friend calls me”).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Demonstrate</strong> how the senses <strong>work together</strong> to give clearer information by completing guided multisensory tasks (e.g., recognizing an object faster when both seeing and touching it).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Distinguish</strong> differences in <strong>personal sensory preferences or sensitivities</strong> by observing themselves and classmates (e.g., “I like quiet spaces, but my friend likes music while working”).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Apply</strong> the idea that people experience sensory input differently by <strong>suggesting or using simple tools or adjustments</strong> that help everyone’s senses work well (e.g., lowering noise for a friend who finds sound too loud, using brighter light to see better).</p></li>

<td>Lesson 1: Our Senses — The Mind’s Doorways</td>
<td><p><strong>Lesson 1: Our Senses — The Mind’s Doorways</strong></p>
<p>This lesson introduces the senses as the entry points that connect the outside world to the mind. Children learn that sight, sound, and touch act like “doorways,” letting in different kinds of information that the mind then uses to think, feel, and act. Without senses, the mind would not know what is happening around us.</p>
<p>Through guided activities and simple observations, students explore how their senses gather signals—eyes detect colors and shapes, ears take in voices and sounds, and skin notices textures and temperatures. They begin to understand that the senses are not random but highly organized systems, each providing a unique type of information.</p>
<p>The lesson emphasizes curiosity and discovery: students become “sense detectives,” noticing how much they rely on sight, sound, and touch in daily life. This builds the foundation for later lessons on how each sense works individually, how senses combine, and how people may experience them differently. By treating the senses as the mind’s doorways, children start to see psychology as a science of how the mind connects with the world.</p></td>

<td>Lesson 2: Each Sense Tells Us Something Different</td>
<td><p><strong>Lesson 2: Each Sense Tells Us Something Different</strong></p>
<p>This lesson helps children understand that each sense has a unique role in giving the mind specific kinds of information. Sight shows us shapes, colors, and movement; sound brings us voices, music, and signals; touch tells us about textures, temperatures, and safety. Each sense is like a different “reporter” sending its own type of story to the mind.</p>
<p>Through guided observation and playful comparisons, students explore how the information from one sense cannot always replace another—for example, we need eyes to see colors, ears to hear music, and skin to feel warmth. They also notice how the senses sometimes overlap but still give different details.</p>
<p>The lesson emphasizes that by paying attention to what each sense contributes, children become more aware of how the mind gathers knowledge about the world. This builds appreciation for the diversity of sensory input and sets the stage for understanding how the senses combine to give a fuller picture of reality.</p></td>

<td>Lesson 3: How Senses Work Together</td>
<td><p><strong>Lesson 3: How Senses Work Together</strong></p>
<p>This lesson explores how the senses usually work in combination, not in isolation. The mind blends information from sight, sound, and touch to create a fuller and more reliable understanding of the world. For example, watching someone speak while hearing their words makes it easier to follow, or touching and looking at an object together helps us recognize it more clearly.</p>
<p>Through guided experiments and playful activities, children discover the advantages of multisensory teamwork. They may notice how difficult it is to understand a story with their eyes closed compared to open, or how much easier it is to identify an object when they both see and touch it. The lesson highlights that senses act like teammates—each one contributing its strengths so the mind can think, feel, and act more effectively.</p>
<p>By recognizing how senses work together, children begin to see perception as an active process of integration. This insight deepens their appreciation of psychology as the science of how the mind and body collaborate to make sense of everyday life.</p></td>

<td><p><strong>Lesson 4: People Experience Senses in Different Ways</strong></p>
<p>This lesson helps children understand that while everyone has senses, people may experience them differently. Some may hear very softly while others hear more strongly; some may notice textures keenly while others barely feel them; some may need glasses to see clearly while others don’t. These differences are normal and part of what makes each person unique.</p>
<p>Through stories, class discussions, and observation, children learn that two people may sense the same event in different ways. One child may find a sound exciting, while another finds it overwhelming. They also explore how tools like glasses, hearing aids, or noise-canceling headphones can support people whose senses work differently.</p>
<p>The lesson emphasizes empathy and respect: since everyone’s sensory experiences are valid, we should be patient and considerate with one another. Children begin to recognize that understanding differences in sensing is part of caring for others and building stronger communities.</p></td>

<td>Unit 4: Basics of Attention and Focus</td>
<td><p>This unit introduces attention as the mind's spotlight—the active process that determines what we notice, learn, and remember. Students discover that attention isn't a single ability but comes in different forms: sustained attention (staying focused on one task), selective attention (tuning out distractions), and shifting attention (moving focus when needed).</p>
<p>Through four progressive lessons, children learn that attention is like a muscle that can be trained and strengthened through practice, using strategies such as setting focus goals, minimizing distractions, and gently bringing attention back when it wanders.</p>
<p>The unit emphasizes that attention works differently across people and situations—some focus deeply, others scan widely, and factors like energy, interest, and environment all influence attention.</p>
<p>By understanding attention as both a trainable skill and a variable experience, students build self-efficacy ("I can improve my focus"), self-awareness (knowing what helps them concentrate), and empathy (respecting that classmates may need different supports to do their best thinking).</p></td>
<td><p><strong>By the end of this unit, students will be able to:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Define</strong> attention as the mind’s “spotlight” that helps select what to notice, learn, and remember (e.g., “When I point my mind’s light at something, I can see and think about it clearly”).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Distinguish</strong> between the three main types of attention—<strong>sustained, selective,</strong> and <strong>shifting</strong>—by <strong>identifying examples</strong> of each in daily activities (e.g., sustained → finishing a puzzle; selective → ignoring chatter; shifting → changing from reading to listening).</p></li>

<p>This lesson introduces attention as the mind’s spotlight—the ability to shine focus on one thing while ignoring others. Just as a spotlight on a stage helps the audience see the most important part of the play, attention helps the mind pick out what matters from all the sights, sounds, and feelings around us.</p>
<p>Children learn that without attention, the mind’s “storage box” (memory) and “messenger” (feelings) cannot work as well, because attention is what decides what gets noticed and remembered. They explore everyday examples, such as how focusing on a teacher’s words makes it easier to learn, while being distracted makes remembering harder.</p>
<p>Through guided activities, children practice noticing what it feels like when their attention is strong versus when it wanders. The lesson emphasizes curiosity and empowerment: attention is not just something that drifts—it is a skill that can be understood, trained, and used to help learning, playing, and problem-solving.</p></td>

<td><p><strong>Lesson 2: The Different Kinds of Attention</strong></p>
<p>This lesson introduces children to the idea that attention is not just one thing—there are different kinds of attention that the mind uses for different purposes. Sometimes we need <strong>sustained attention</strong> to keep our focus on one activity for a while, like finishing a drawing. Other times we need <strong>selective attention</strong> to block out distractions, like listening to a story even when classmates are talking nearby. And at times we need <strong>shifting attention</strong>, moving our focus quickly when something new or important happens, like stopping a game to hear an instruction.</p>
<p>Through examples and playful activities, children explore how these types of attention show up in their daily lives. They begin to see that the mind has different “spotlight modes,” each useful in its own way. The lesson emphasizes that learning to recognize and practice these kinds of attention gives children more control over how they use their mental spotlight.</p></td>

Children learn that focus is not something we either “have” or “don’t have,” but a skill that can be improved through simple strategies.</p>
<p>Through guided activities, students practice techniques such as short bursts of concentration followed by breaks, using a “focus goal” to stay on task, and finding simple anchors like looking at a teacher’s eyes, listening for key words, or pointing to what they are working on. They also explore the idea of noticing when attention drifts and gently bringing it back, without judgment.</p>
<p>The lesson emphasizes empowerment: by practicing focus strategies, children build confidence that they can influence their own attention. This supports self-efficacy and resilience, helping them feel capable of handling classroom challenges, games, and everyday tasks.</p></td>

<p>This lesson helps children recognize that while everyone uses attention, it does not look the same for all people. Some children can focus deeply for a long time, while others notice many things quickly. Some find it easy to shift their focus, while others need more time. Even within one person, attention can change depending on how tired, excited, or interested they feel.</p>
<p>Through stories, classroom activities, and reflection, students explore examples of these differences and see that they are a normal part of how minds work. The lesson emphasizes that noticing and respecting attention differences helps us learn and play together more successfully. Children also begin to reflect on what helps their own attention and how they can be considerate of others’ needs.</p>
<p>By understanding attention as both shared and varied, students strengthen empathy, self-awareness, and confidence in using strategies that support their focus.

<p>Through four progressive lessons, children discover the information-processing model of memory (noticing/encoding → storing → retrieving), understand that attention is crucial for forming strong memories, and learn practical strategies to strengthen memory (repetition, association, storytelling, visualization).</p>
<p>The unit concludes by normalizing memory's imperfections: different people remember the same events differently based on what they noticed, and forgetting is a normal part of how memory works, not a failure.</p>
<p>This knowledge-based approach empowers students with self-efficacy ("I can help my memory work better") while building perspective-taking skills and resilience around memory's natural limitations.</p></td>

Children explore memory through a simple metaphor: a “storage box” or “treasure chest” where experiences, knowledge, and skills are kept safe until they are called upon. They learn that memory is what helps us remember names, songs, places, and even how to ride a bike or play a game.</p>
<p>Through guided examples and playful activities, students begin to see memory as a reliable mental tool rather than something mysterious. They discover that memory works for everyone, even if people remember different things or in different ways.</p>
<p>The lesson emphasizes curiosity and empowerment: memory is not just something that “happens to us,” it is a function of the mind we can notice, explore, and understand.

<td>Lesson 2: Making Memories — How We Remember Things</td>
<td><p><strong>Lesson 2: Making Memories — How We Remember Things</strong></p>
<p>This lesson explores how memories are created. Children learn that remembering is not automatic; it begins when we pay attention and notice details. The mind then stores what we notice, so it can be brought back later. To make this concrete, memory is compared to “taking a snapshot” or “collecting a treasure” — what we notice carefully gets stored, while what we ignore may fade away.</p>
<p>Students discover three simple steps in the memory process: noticing (paying attention), storing (keeping it safe), and bringing back (retrieving). Activities show that paying attention helps memory stick, while distraction makes remembering harder. The lesson emphasizes that we can help our minds remember by focusing carefully and linking new information to things we already know.</p>
<p>This framing introduces the foundation of the <strong>information-processing model of memory</strong> (encoding → storage → retrieval) in a child-friendly way, while empowering children with the idea that memory is not random but shaped by how they use their attention.</p></td>

<td>Lesson 3: Strengthening Memory — Tricks Our Mind Uses</td>
<td><p><strong>Lesson 3: Strengthening Memory — Tricks Our Mind Uses</strong></p>
<p>This lesson shows children that memory can be strengthened with simple strategies. Just as muscles get stronger with exercise, memory grows stronger when we use certain “mind tricks.” Students discover that repeating something, making connections, turning ideas into stories, or creating mental pictures all help memory hold on more tightly.</p>
<p>Activities allow children to practice these strategies in playful, everyday ways—for example, remembering a short list by making it into a silly story, or linking a new word to something they already know. The emphasis is on empowerment: children are not stuck with their memory “as is”; they can actively help their minds remember better.</p>
<p>This lesson is grounded in developmental psychology research on mnemonic strategies and Vygotsky’s idea of “mental tools.” By learning that memory is flexible and improvable, children begin building self-efficacy: “I can do something to help my memory.” This shift from passive to active understanding makes memory feel like a skill, not just a function.</p></td>

Memory is constructive: our minds rebuild experiences when we recall them, which means they may come out a little differently each time.</p>
<p>Through simple examples and activities, children explore how two classmates might notice and remember different details of the same story, or how their own recollection of an event changes over time. The focus is on normalizing these differences and lapses: forgetting is not failure, and remembering differently does not mean someone is wrong. Instead, memory reflects what stood out to each person and how their mind connected the experience.</p>
<p>This lesson emphasizes perspective-taking and resilience. By understanding that memories vary, children learn to value their own and others’ perspectives without judgment, and to feel reassured that forgetting is a normal part of how memory works.</p></td>

<td>Unit 6: Family and Friendship Dynamics</td>
<td><p>This unit shifts from individual cognitive processes to the social systems that shape children's psychological development. Students learn that families function as their "first teams"—foundational social structures where they experience roles, responsibilities, and cooperation, with members contributing differently toward shared well-being. Through exploring what makes friendships strong (kindness, trust, sharing, listening, respect), children discover that friendship is a learnable skill rather than something that simply "happens."</p>
<p>The unit normalizes relationship challenges by teaching that disagreements and conflicts are natural parts of family and friendship life. What matters is learning to work through problems together using strategies like listening, taking turns, compromising, and asking for help when needed—reframing conflict as an opportunity to strengthen relationships through cooperative problem-solving. The final lesson celebrates diversity in both family structures and friendship patterns, emphasizing that what makes relationships strong is the quality of care, respect, and support within them, not their external form.</p>
<p>By examining relationships as systems that can be understood and skillfully navigated, this unit treats students as objective learners gaining knowledge about how human connection works. Understanding relationship dynamics builds self-efficacy ("I can be a good friend and team member") and resilience ("I can handle conflicts and differences"), while fostering empathy and inclusivity as foundations for healthy social development.</p></td>

<td>Unit 7: Imagination and Storytelling</td>
<td><p>This unit explores imagination as a fundamental cognitive capacity—the mind's ability to create ideas, pictures, and possibilities beyond immediate perception. Students learn that imagination functions as the "mind's playground," a mental space where they can explore "what if" scenarios, combine ideas in novel ways, and draw on memory, thinking, and feelings to generate creative possibilities. Far from being mere fantasy or daydreaming, imagination emerges as a practical tool that supports learning, creativity, and everyday problem-solving.</p>
<p>Through four progressive lessons, children discover how storytelling structures imagination into shareable narratives with beginnings, middles, and endings—making abstract ideas concrete and communicable. They learn that storytelling serves as both a cognitive organizing tool (helping minds arrange thoughts and feelings coherently) and a social bridge (allowing people to share inner worlds and understand others' perspectives). The unit emphasizes imagination's practical applications: students practice generating multiple solutions to challenges, "seeing ahead" to test possibilities before acting, and recognizing that when one approach fails, imagination enables them to ask "What else could I try?"</p>
<p>The final lesson highlights the social dimension of imaginative storytelling—how sharing stories builds empathy, creates connection across differences, and strengthens communities. Students practice both expressing their own narratives and listening to others' stories, recognizing that everyone has valuable perspectives to share. By framing imagination and storytelling as interconnected mental capacities that integrate with other cognitive processes (memory provides content, thinking organizes structure, feelings guide meaning), this unit reinforces psychology as the study of how minds work while building children's confidence in their creative and communicative abilities as tools for both personal resilience and social belonging.</p></td>

Imagination is like a playground inside the mind—a space where we can try out new ideas, build stories, and explore “what if” situations safely. Children discover that imagination is not just daydreaming or fantasy; it is a powerful mental tool that supports learning, creativity, and problem-solving.</p>
<p>Through guided activities and play, students explore how imagination allows them to picture things they’ve never seen, combine ideas in new ways, and bring past experiences into new contexts. They learn that imagination is part of how everyone’s mind works, though people may imagine in different ways—through pictures, words, sounds, or feelings.</p>
<p>The lesson emphasizes that imagination connects to other parts of the mind: it uses memory to pull out ideas, thinking to organize them, and feelings to bring them to life. By recognizing imagination as a natural strength, children begin to value it as more than “pretend”—they see it as a mental capacity that enriches their everyday life.</p></td>

Stories are how people make sense of their experiences, share knowledge, and connect with others.</p>
<p>Through guided activities, students practice turning imaginative ideas into short stories, using characters, settings, and simple plots. They learn that stories can be about real events, imagined worlds, or a mix of both. The lesson highlights that storytelling is not just entertainment; it is a mental tool that organizes thoughts and feelings, helping us remember, explain, and connect.</p>

<td>Unit 8: Problem-Solving Basics</td>
<td><p>This unit frames problems as normal parts of life and opportunities for the mind to work. Students learn that problems are not “bad” or shameful; they are puzzles that invite the mind’s tools—thinking, feeling, and doing—to find a way forward. Using real stories and classroom examples, children notice that problems come in different sizes (small everyday hassles, medium disagreements, larger challenges) and that everyone—kids and adults—faces them.</p>
<p>Students practice a clear, reliable four-step model: Stop and Notice → Think of Options → Choose One → Try It Out.

They also discover that most problems allow more than one possible solution; imagination and flexible thinking help them generate multiple options, compare them, and select a good fit.</p>
<p>When first attempts don’t work, children learn to persist, adjust, and try again, and to recognize help-seeking as a smart strategy rather than a weakness. Family, friends, and teachers can offer ideas or support, making problem-solving a cooperative process. By the end of the unit, students understand that solving problems means thinking carefully before acting, choosing and testing solutions, and refining with persistence and help.

<p>Through guided practice and role-play, students learn to apply these steps to small, familiar problems, such as disagreements over a toy or deciding how to finish a classroom task. They discover that having a process helps them feel calmer and more confident, even when the situation is tricky.</p>
<p>The lesson emphasizes that problem-solving is not about always getting the perfect answer the first time; it is about having a plan to try, adjust, and learn from.

<td>Unit 9: Our Actions and Impact</td>
<td><p>This unit introduces actions as part of a cause-and-effect system that shapes what happens in our lives and surroundings. Students learn that every action produces an effect, like ripples in water—some appear right away, others unfold over time. They explore everyday examples showing how their choices influence themselves, other people, and the environment, building awareness that actions matter because they set things in motion.</p>
<p>As the lessons progress, children discover that small choices can lead to big outcomes and that they can guide their actions intentionally toward helpful results. Through stories, examples, and role-play, they compare helpful and unhelpful behaviors, practice choosing actions that support kindness, fairness, and care, and recognize that responsibility means directing their choices thoughtfully rather than reacting automatically.</p>
<p>Finally, students learn that mistakes are part of learning. When actions don’t bring the results they hoped for, they practice noticing what happened, making things right, and trying again.

<p>This lesson introduces children to the foundational idea that every action creates an effect. Actions are like pebbles dropped into water—they make ripples that spread outward. Sometimes the effect is immediate, like helping a classmate pick up books and seeing them smile. Other times the effect takes longer, like remembering to water a plant and watching it grow over days.</p>
<p>Through guided activities, children notice cause-and-effect links between their actions and outcomes for themselves, others, and their surroundings. They explore both positive and negative examples: sharing can build friendship, while leaving someone out can hurt feelings. The lesson emphasizes that actions matter because they set things in motion, shaping what happens next.</p>
<p>By seeing actions as connected to outcomes, children begin to understand responsibility—not as blame, but as awareness of how their choices influence the world. This perspective lays the groundwork for building self-efficacy: if their actions create effects, then they also have the power to choose actions that lead to helpful results.</p></td>

Saying “thank you,” including a classmate in a game, or turning off the tap while brushing teeth may seem tiny, but these actions add up to create meaningful effects for ourselves, others, and the environment.</p>
<p>Through stories, examples, and simple activities, students explore how repeated small actions build patterns: kindness can strengthen friendships, responsibility can build trust, and wasteful habits can harm shared spaces. They learn that every choice is like planting a seed—it may be small, but over time it grows into something larger.</p>
<p>The lesson emphasizes empowerment: children may feel small in a big world, but their everyday actions carry real weight. By seeing how small choices accumulate, they gain confidence that they can make a difference in their families, classrooms, and communities.</p></td>

<td>Lesson 3: Choosing Helpful Actions</td>
<td><p><strong>Lesson 3: Choosing Helpful Actions</strong></p>
<p>Children learn that while every action creates effects, they can choose actions intentionally based on desired outcomes. The lesson distinguishes helpful actions (supporting themselves, others, and environment) from unhelpful ones (creating problems or harm) through cause-effect analysis rather than moral judgment. Students practice the thinking sequence: "What do I want to happen?" → "Which action will help that happen?" → "I choose that one."</p>
<p>Through role-play and concrete scenarios, children compare action-effect pairs in familiar contexts: sharing versus grabbing materials, kind versus mean words, including versus excluding classmates. They discover patterns showing how certain actions consistently produce helpful outcomes (cooperation builds friendships, responsibility earns trust) while others create problems (exclusion causes hurt, carelessness creates extra work). Activities guide students to predict consequences before acting and select actions strategically.</p>
<p>This integrates the mind's three parts: Thinking predicts consequences, Feeling provides information about what matters to self and others, and Doing executes the chosen action. The approach aligns with self-determination theory—children develop competence and autonomy not from being told they're "good," but from understanding causal mechanisms linking choices to effects.</p>
<p>The lesson normalizes that choosing helpful actions isn't always easy when frustrated or tired, but that the thinking-before-acting pattern strengthens with practice. This builds self-efficacy through genuine control over outcomes rather than mere compliance, supporting executive function development through scaffolded practice.</p></td>

<td>Lesson 4: Learning from Mistakes</td>
<td><p><strong>Lesson 4: Learning from Mistakes</strong></p>
<p>Mistakes are reframed as natural feedback within the action-effect system rather than failures requiring shame. When actions produce unexpected or unwanted effects, the resulting information helps minds learn and adjust. Students practice the pattern: Action → Unwanted Effect → Notice What Happened → Make It Right → Try Differently Next Time, using age-appropriate examples like accidentally knocking over blocks, helping rebuild them, and moving carefully afterward.</p>
<p>Children distinguish between accidents (unintended effects) and poor choices (intended actions creating problems), recognizing both as learning opportunities. Making things right involves acknowledging what happened, repairing effects when possible, and changing future patterns—aligning with restorative justice principles. Students practice meaningful apologies connected to specific actions and effects, contrasting these with empty apologies or excuses.</p>
<p>The lesson normalizes mistakes as universal experiences where actions and outcomes didn't match, providing adjustment information. This growth mindset approach (Dweck) builds resilience by framing setbacks as learning moments rather than evidence of inadequacy. Activities analyze scenarios through "What was the action? What was the effect? What could work differently?" developing metacognitive awareness.</p>
<p>Ending Unit 9 with learning from mistakes completes the action-impact framework: actions create effects (L1), small actions accumulate (L2), strategic action selection is possible (L3), and mismatches provide learning opportunities (L4). This prepares students to apply individual action-awareness skills in Unit 10's collaborative contexts, building confidence that struggle leads to competence.</p></td>

Students learn that teamwork requires intentional choices—listening carefully, taking turns, sharing roles, and respecting others—rather than simply working in proximity. Through collaborative activities and games, children discover that strong teams distribute responsibility so everyone contributes meaningfully, recognizing that different roles (leading, organizing, creating, supporting) are all valuable and necessary for success.</p>
<p>The unit normalizes challenges within teamwork by teaching that disagreements, mistakes, and conflicts are natural parts of collaboration. What distinguishes strong teams is not the absence of problems but the ability to solve them cooperatively through listening, compromising, and making group decisions. Students practice strategies for working through team challenges, discovering that addressing problems together builds trust, respect, and resilience rather than weakening the group.</p>
<p>The final lesson emphasizes celebrating collective achievements, teaching that success belongs to the group rather than individuals. Recognition and encouragement strengthen team spirit, building pride, connection, and belonging among members. By framing celebration as appreciation for effort and growth rather than "winning," the unit reinforces that cooperation itself is rewarding and meaningful.</p>
<p>This capstone unit integrates the year's learning—applying thinking (generating solutions), feeling (recognizing emotions in self and others), and doing (choosing helpful actions)—within social contexts, completing the curriculum's progression from individual psychological processes to collaborative social systems. Students finish Grade 1 with confidence in both their individual capabilities and their value as contributing team members in families, classrooms, and communities.</p></td>
<td><p><strong>By the end of this unit, students will be able to:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Identify</strong> the essential components of teamwork by <strong>distinguishing</strong> between groups working in proximity versus groups cooperating toward shared goals (e.g., recognizing that sitting near classmates during independent work is different from coordinating roles to build a block tower together).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Demonstrate</strong> cooperative behaviors that strengthen team functioning by taking turns, listening to others' ideas, and contributing meaningfully to assigned roles during structured group activities (e.g., in a classroom cleanup task, waiting for turn to speak during planning, accepting the role of "materials organizer," and completing that responsibility).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Apply</strong> conflict-resolution strategies when team challenges arise by listening to different perspectives, proposing compromises, and making group decisions that allow work to continue (e.g., when two teammates want the same role, suggesting they switch halfway through or finding a related role that uses similar skills).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recognize</strong> that different team roles contribute equally to collective success by <strong>describing</strong> how various functions—leading, organizing, creating, supporting—are each necessary and valuable (e.g., explaining that "the idea person, the builder, and the person who gets materials all helped us finish the project").</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Explain</strong> how celebrating group achievements builds team connection by <strong>describing</strong> the difference between individual recognition ("I won") and collective celebration ("we worked together and succeeded"), using examples from classroom team experiences to show how shared recognition strengthens belonging and motivation for future cooperation.</p></li>

<td>Lesson 1: Working Together Toward a Goal</td>
<td><p><strong>Lesson 1: Working Together Toward a Goal</strong></p>
<p>This lesson introduces teamwork as the process of joining efforts with others to achieve something that no one person could do as easily alone. Children discover that cooperation means combining strengths—sharing ideas, helping hands, and encouragement—to reach a shared goal. Just as in a sports team, orchestra, or building project, teamwork is about more than individual effort; it is about coordination and support.</p>
<p>Through classroom games and collaborative activities, students experience how working together changes what is possible. They notice that tasks become faster, easier, or more enjoyable when people cooperate. The lesson also highlights that teamwork requires intentional choices: listening, respecting others, and committing to the group’s goal.</p>
<p>By recognizing teamwork as a skill, children begin to see themselves not only as independent problem-solvers but also as valuable members of groups. This perspective builds both competence and belonging—key developmental needs at this age.</p></td>

<td>Lesson 2: Listening and Sharing Roles</td>
<td><p><strong>Lesson 2: Listening and Sharing Roles</strong></p>
<p>This lesson focuses on the core skills that make teamwork possible: listening carefully to others, taking turns, and sharing roles so that everyone contributes. Children learn that a strong team is not made up of one person doing everything but of many people each playing a part. Listening shows respect, sharing roles spreads responsibility, and turn-taking ensures fairness.</p>
<p>Through cooperative games and group tasks, students experience how teamwork breaks down when people don’t listen or when one person takes over, compared to how smoothly it works when everyone participates. They also learn that different roles are valuable—some lead, some organize, some create, some support—and that all are needed for success.</p>
<p>The lesson emphasizes respect and inclusion: when everyone has a role, each member feels important, and the team is stronger. By practicing these skills, children build the foundation for fair play, collaboration in learning, and confidence in group settings.</p></td>

<td><p><strong>Lesson 3: Solving Problems as a Team</strong></p>
<p>This lesson helps children understand that teamwork does not mean everything always runs smoothly—disagreements, mistakes, and challenges are a natural part of working together. What makes a team strong is not the absence of problems, but the ability to solve them cooperatively.</p>
<p>Through role-play and group activities, students practice strategies for team problem-solving: listening to each person’s idea, sharing feelings respectfully, finding compromises, and agreeing on a plan. They notice that when team members argue without listening, tasks stall, but when they cooperate to find solutions, the team can move forward stronger than before.</p>
<p>The lesson emphasizes that solving problems as a team builds trust, respect, and resilience. Children begin to see teamwork not as “perfect harmony” but as a process where challenges are met with shared effort and communication.</p></td>

<td><p><strong>Lesson 4: Celebrating What We Achieve Together</strong></p>
<p>This lesson emphasizes the importance of recognizing and celebrating what teams accomplish. Children learn that success is not only about individual effort but about the group’s shared work—listening, cooperating, and supporting each other along the way. Just as sports teams cheer after a game or a class claps for a group presentation, celebrating achievements strengthens the sense of belonging and pride in what was built together.</p>
<p>Through classroom activities, students experience how recognition and encouragement boost team spirit. They reflect on the feelings of contributing to a group success—pride, connection, and joy—and notice how acknowledging others’ efforts makes everyone feel valued. The lesson highlights that celebration is not about winning or being “the best,” but about appreciating teamwork, effort, and growth.</p>
<p>By ending the unit with celebration, children internalize that cooperation is rewarding, meaningful, and something to look forward to. This builds motivation to bring teamwork skills into future challenges at school, home, and community.</p></td>
