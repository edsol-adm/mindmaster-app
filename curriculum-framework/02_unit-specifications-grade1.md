## Unit 1: What is Psychology?

|  | Description | Learning Outcomes |
|---|---|---|
| **Unit 1: What is Psychology?** | This foundational unit introduces students to the mind as an interconnected system with three essential parts: Thinking (the "Idea Factory" for planning, problem-solving, and imagining), Feeling (the "Messenger" providing information through emotions and body sensations), and Doing (the "Action Player" making our inner world visible through observable actions). Students learn that everyone has a mind with these same three parts, though they work together differently in different situations.<br>Through concrete daily-life examples, sorting activities, and observation exercises, children identify and label these three parts in themselves and others. They practice distinguishing between private mental experiences (thinking and feeling happen inside, invisible to others) and observable actions (doing is what others see). Role-play and cause-and-effect scenarios help students describe how the parts influence one another using simple language: "I thought about..., then I felt..., so I did..."<br>The three-part model establishes psychology's foundational framework—that mental processes can be observed, categorized, and understood systematically. This introduces age-appropriate metacognition (thinking about thinking) by making abstract internal experiences concrete through metaphor and observable examples, providing the organizing structure for understanding all future psychology concepts.<br>By framing the mind as an understandable system rather than a mysterious black box, students develop foundational psychological literacy and self-efficacy ("I can understand how my mind works"). The shared vocabulary enables both self-awareness and empathy, supporting children to discuss mental experiences that will underpin learning about attention, memory, emotions, relationships, and problem-solving throughout the curriculum. | By the end of this unit, students will be able to:<br>Define psychology as the study of how minds work and explain that everyone has a mind with three parts: Thinking, Feeling, and Doing<br>Identify and label examples of thinking (Idea Factory), feeling (Messenger), and doing (Action Player) in everyday scenarios from their own lives or observations of others<br>Distinguish between private mental experiences (thinking and feeling) and observable actions (doing) by categorizing given examples as "inside my mind" or "others can see"<br>Describe how the three parts of the mind work together and influence one another using simple cause-and-effect language (e.g., "I thought about..., then I felt..., so I did...")<br>Use the framework vocabulary (Idea Factory, Messenger, Action Player) to discuss their own mental experiences and explain their actions or the actions of others |
| **Lesson 1: How Our Minds Work** | Lesson 1: How Our Minds Work <br>This lesson introduces the mind as a system with three interconnected parts: Thinking (making ideas, solving problems, planning), Feeling (emotions and body sensations that give us information), and Doing (actions our bodies take).<br>Through concrete examples from daily life, children explore how these parts work together and influence each other. They learn to identify which parts are active in different situations and recognize that everyone's mind has these same three parts. The lesson emphasizes observation and curiosity—children become "mind scientists" noticing how their minds (and others' minds) work in action.<br>This foundational framework provides the organizing structure for understanding all future psychology concepts and gives children a shared language for discussing mental experiences. | By the end of Lesson 1, students will be able to:<br>Identify the three parts of the mind—Thinking, Feeling, and Doing—and give one example of each from daily life.<br>Recognize which part of the mind is active in common scenarios (e.g., correctly sorting situation cards or identifying that "planning a game" is Thinking).<br>Explain how the three parts work together in a specific situation (e.g., "I felt scared, thought the dog might jump, so I stepped back").<br>Describe the three parts of the mind at work in another person during an observed activity or role-play.<br>Apply the mind framework to analyze a recent personal experience, identifying where Thinking, Feeling, and Doing each occurred. |
| **Lesson 2: Thinking - Our Mind's Idea Factory** | Lesson 2: Thinking - Our Mind's Idea Factory <br>This lesson explores the Thinking part of the mind in depth, teaching children that thinking includes many different jobs: remembering, imagining, planning, solving problems, wondering, and making decisions. Children learn that their "Idea Factory" is constantly working—even when they're quiet or sitting still—and that thinking happens privately inside their heads where others can't see it.<br>Through hands-on activities, children discover that they can use their Idea Factory deliberately to help them in everyday situations: generating multiple solutions to problems, thinking before acting, remembering important information, and imagining possibilities. They also learn that everyone's Idea Factory works a bit differently—some people think in pictures, some in words, some need quiet to think, others think better with movement.<br>The lesson emphasizes that thinking is a tool children can learn to use more skillfully, and that noticing when and how they're thinking helps them make better choices and understand others better. | By the end of Lesson 2, students will be able to:<br>Identify at least three different types of thinking their Idea Factory does (e.g., remembering, imagining, planning, problem-solving, wondering, deciding) and give an example of each from their own experience.<br>Explain that thinking happens privately inside our heads where others cannot see it, even when our bodies are still or quiet.<br>Apply deliberate thinking to solve a simple problem by generating multiple possible solutions before choosing one (e.g., "What could I do if I forgot my lunch?").<br>Recognize that different people's Idea Factories work in different ways (e.g., thinking in pictures vs. words, needing quiet vs. movement) by observing and describing examples from themselves and classmates.<br>Demonstrate the practice of "thinking before acting" by pausing to use their Idea Factory in a scenario and explaining what they thought about before deciding what to do. |
| **Lesson 3: Feeling - Our Mind's Messenger** | Lesson 3: Feeling - Our Mind's Messenger<br>This lesson explores the Feeling part of the mind, teaching children that feelings are information messengers that tell us important things about ourselves and our situations. Children learn that feelings aren't just "good" or "bad"—they all serve useful purposes: fear warns us about possible danger, sadness tells us something matters to us, anger signals something feels unfair, excitement tells us something good is happening.<br>Through concrete activities, children discover that feelings show up in two places: in their minds (knowing "I feel happy") and in their bodies (butterflies in stomach, warmth in chest, tight shoulders). They learn to identify different feelings, notice where they feel them physically, and understand that the same situation can create different feelings in different people.<br>The lesson emphasizes that feelings are normal, everyone has them, and they give us valuable information—but feelings are messages to notice and understand, not instructions we must follow. Children begin to see how feelings connect to the other mind parts: feelings can spark thinking, and thinking can help us understand what our feeling-messengers are telling us. | By the end of Lesson 3, students will be able to:<br>Identify at least four different feelings by name and describe what information each one communicates (e.g., "Fear warns me about danger" or "Sadness tells me something important to me is gone or hurt").<br>Locate where specific feelings appear in their body (e.g., pointing to stomach for nervous, chest for excited, or shoulders for worried).<br>Distinguish between a feeling as information and a feeling as an instruction (e.g., "I feel angry, which tells me something seems unfair, but I can choose what to do about it").<br>Recognize that the same situation can create different feelings in different people and provide an example (e.g., "The loud assembly made me feel excited but made my friend feel overwhelmed").<br>Explain how feelings connect to thinking and doing in a specific scenario (e.g., "My body felt nervous, then I thought about why, and I realized I was worried about the test"). |
| **Lesson 4: Doing - Our Mind's Action Player** | Lesson 4: Doing - Our Mind's Action Player <br>This lesson explores the Doing part of the mind, teaching children that actions are what make our inner world (thinking and feeling) visible to others. Children learn that their "Action Player" includes everything observable: speaking, moving, facial expressions, gestures, and choices about what to do or not do.<br>Through concrete activities, children discover how Thinking and Feeling guide their Action Player in different ways. They explore real-life scenarios showing various pathways: sometimes a strong feeling leads directly to quick action, sometimes thinking plans an action carefully, and sometimes thinking and feeling work together to choose an action. Children learn that while they can't always control what they think or feel, they have the most control over their doing—and that this control grows with practice.<br>The lesson emphasizes that actions have effects on ourselves and others, that we can pause between feeling/thinking and doing, and that observing others' actions helps us understand what might be happening in their minds. This integrates all three components, showing children how their minds work as a complete system. | By the end of Lesson 4, students will be able to:<br>Identify at least four types of observable actions their Action Player produces (e.g., speaking, facial expressions, body movements, or choosing to wait).<br>Explain how thinking and feeling each guide actions using specific examples (e.g., "My feeling of anger made me want to yell, but my thinking helped me choose to walk away" or "I felt excited and immediately ran to tell my friend").<br>Distinguish between actions they can control and thoughts or feelings they cannot control (e.g., "I can't stop feeling nervous, but I can choose whether to try the hard problem").<br>Demonstrate the pause between thinking/feeling and doing by describing or showing a moment where they noticed an urge and chose a different action.<br>Infer what someone else might be thinking or feeling based on their observable actions (e.g., "When she crossed her arms and turned away, she might have been feeling angry or hurt"). |

## Unit 2: Exploring Our Senses (Sight, Sound, Touch)

|  | Description | Learning Outcomes |
|---|---|---|
| **Unit 2: Exploring Our Senses (Sight, Sound, Touch)** | This unit introduces sensation as the foundational process connecting the external world to the mind's internal workings. Students learn that the senses function as "doorways" or information-gathering systems, each providing unique types of data—sight delivers colors and shapes, sound brings voices and signals, touch conveys textures and temperatures. <br>Through four progressive lessons, children discover how each sense contributes its own specialized information, how senses typically work as a team to create fuller understanding (multisensory integration makes experiences clearer and safer), and that people experience sensory input differently based on individual variations in sensitivity, preferences, and needs. <br>The unit emphasizes observation and empathy: students become "sense detectives" exploring their own sensory experiences while recognizing that classmates may perceive the same situations differently, and that tools or accommodations help everyone's senses work effectively. <br>By framing sensation as the mind's data collection system, this unit reinforces psychology as the science of how internal mental processes (thinking, feeling, doing) connect with and respond to external reality, building both self-awareness and understanding of others. | By the end of this unit, students will be able to:<br>Identify the three main senses—sight, sound, and touch—and match each to the type of information it gathers (e.g., sight → colors/shapes, sound → voices/noises, touch → textures/temperature).<br>Describe how each sense helps the mind notice and learn about the world, using simple real-life examples (e.g., “My eyes help me find my shoes”; “My ears tell me when my friend calls me”).<br>Demonstrate how the senses work together to give clearer information by completing guided multisensory tasks (e.g., recognizing an object faster when both seeing and touching it).<br>Distinguish differences in personal sensory preferences or sensitivities by observing themselves and classmates (e.g., “I like quiet spaces, but my friend likes music while working”).<br>Apply the idea that people experience sensory input differently by suggesting or using simple tools or adjustments that help everyone’s senses work well (e.g., lowering noise for a friend who finds sound too loud, using brighter light to see better). |
| **Lesson 1: Our Senses — The Mind’s Doorways** | Lesson 1: Our Senses — The Mind’s Doorways <br>This lesson introduces the senses as the entry points that connect the outside world to the mind. Children learn that sight, sound, and touch act like “doorways,” letting in different kinds of information that the mind then uses to think, feel, and act. Without senses, the mind would not know what is happening around us.<br>Through guided activities and simple observations, students explore how their senses gather signals—eyes detect colors and shapes, ears take in voices and sounds, and skin notices textures and temperatures. They begin to understand that the senses are not random but highly organized systems, each providing a unique type of information.<br>The lesson emphasizes curiosity and discovery: students become “sense detectives,” noticing how much they rely on sight, sound, and touch in daily life. This builds the foundation for later lessons on how each sense works individually, how senses combine, and how people may experience them differently. By treating the senses as the mind’s doorways, children start to see psychology as a science of how the mind connects with the world. | By the end of Lesson 1, students will be able to:<br>Identify the three main senses—sight, sound, and touch—as doorways that let information into the mind.<br>Explain that without senses, the mind wouldn't know what is happening in the world around us.<br>Match each sense to examples of information it provides (e.g., sight → colors and shapes, sound → voices and music, touch → textures and temperature).<br>Describe how senses function as organized systems, each with a specific job, rather than random experiences.<br>Recognize through observation how much they rely on sight, sound, and touch in a typical activity (e.g., eating lunch, playing a game). |
| **Lesson 2: Each Sense Tells Us Something Different** | Lesson 2: Each Sense Tells Us Something Different<br>This lesson helps children understand that each sense has a unique role in giving the mind specific kinds of information. Sight shows us shapes, colors, and movement; sound brings us voices, music, and signals; touch tells us about textures, temperatures, and safety. Each sense is like a different “reporter” sending its own type of story to the mind.<br>Through guided observation and playful comparisons, students explore how the information from one sense cannot always replace another—for example, we need eyes to see colors, ears to hear music, and skin to feel warmth. They also notice how the senses sometimes overlap but still give different details.<br>The lesson emphasizes that by paying attention to what each sense contributes, children become more aware of how the mind gathers knowledge about the world. This builds appreciation for the diversity of sensory input and sets the stage for understanding how the senses combine to give a fuller picture of reality. | By the end of Lesson 2, students will be able to:<br>Distinguish the unique type of information each sense provides (e.g., only eyes can detect color; only ears can hear music).<br>Explain why one sense cannot fully replace another using concrete examples (e.g., "I can't hear a color" or "I can't see how warm something is without touching").<br>Identify which sense(s) would be most useful in specific scenarios (e.g., finding a ringing phone → hearing; choosing a ripe fruit → sight and touch).<br>Describe how different senses provide different details about the same object or event.<br>Apply sensory awareness by deliberately focusing on what each sense contributes during an observation activity. |
| **Lesson 3: How Senses Work Together** | Lesson 3: How Senses Work Together<br>This lesson explores how the senses usually work in combination, not in isolation. The mind blends information from sight, sound, and touch to create a fuller and more reliable understanding of the world. For example, watching someone speak while hearing their words makes it easier to follow, or touching and looking at an object together helps us recognize it more clearly.<br>Through guided experiments and playful activities, children discover the advantages of multisensory teamwork. They may notice how difficult it is to understand a story with their eyes closed compared to open, or how much easier it is to identify an object when they both see and touch it. The lesson highlights that senses act like teammates—each one contributing its strengths so the mind can think, feel, and act more effectively.<br>By recognizing how senses work together, children begin to see perception as an active process of integration. This insight deepens their appreciation of psychology as the science of how the mind and body collaborate to make sense of everyday life. | By the end of Lesson 3, students will be able to:<br>Explain that the mind typically combines information from multiple senses to create fuller understanding.<br>Demonstrate through comparison how tasks are easier or clearer when multiple senses work together (e.g., recognizing an object faster when both seeing and touching it).<br>Identify examples of multisensory teamwork in daily life (e.g., watching someone's face while hearing their words makes conversation clearer).<br>Describe what happens when one sense is unavailable and others must work harder to compensate.<br>Recognize that senses act like teammates, each contributing strengths so the mind can think, feel, and act more effectively. |
| **Lesson 4: People Experience Senses in Different Ways** | Lesson 4: People Experience Senses in Different Ways<br>This lesson helps children understand that while everyone has senses, people may experience them differently. Some may hear very softly while others hear more strongly; some may notice textures keenly while others barely feel them; some may need glasses to see clearly while others don’t. These differences are normal and part of what makes each person unique.<br>Through stories, class discussions, and observation, children learn that two people may sense the same event in different ways. One child may find a sound exciting, while another finds it overwhelming. They also explore how tools like glasses, hearing aids, or noise-canceling headphones can support people whose senses work differently.<br>The lesson emphasizes empathy and respect: since everyone’s sensory experiences are valid, we should be patient and considerate with one another. Children begin to recognize that understanding differences in sensing is part of caring for others and building stronger communities. | By the end of Lesson 4, students will be able to:<br>Recognize that people experience the same sensory input differently (e.g., one child finds a sound exciting while another finds it overwhelming).<br>Identify examples of sensory differences in themselves or classmates (e.g., "I like bright lights; my friend needs dimmer lighting to feel comfortable").<br>Explain that tools like glasses, hearing aids, or noise-canceling headphones help people whose senses work differently.<br>Demonstrate respect for sensory differences by suggesting or accepting adjustments that help everyone's senses work well (e.g., lowering classroom volume, improving lighting).<br>Apply empathy by recognizing that different sensory preferences and sensitivities are normal variations in how minds receive information. |

## Unit 3: Basics of Attention and Focus

|  | Description | Learning Outcomes |
|---|---|---|
| **Unit 3: Basics of Attention and Focus** | This unit introduces attention as the mind's spotlight—the active process that determines what we notice, learn, and remember. Students discover that attention isn't a single ability but comes in different forms: sustained attention (staying focused on one task), selective attention (tuning out distractions), and shifting attention (moving focus when needed). <br>Through four progressive lessons, children learn that attention is like a muscle that can be trained and strengthened through practice, using strategies such as setting focus goals, minimizing distractions, and gently bringing attention back when it wanders. <br>The unit emphasizes that attention works differently across people and situations—some focus deeply, others scan widely, and factors like energy, interest, and environment all influence attention. <br>By understanding attention as both a trainable skill and a variable experience, students build self-efficacy ("I can improve my focus"), self-awareness (knowing what helps them concentrate), and empathy (respecting that classmates may need different supports to do their best thinking). | By the end of this unit, students will be able to:<br>Define attention as the mind’s “spotlight” that helps select what to notice, learn, and remember (e.g., “When I point my mind’s light at something, I can see and think about it clearly”).<br>Distinguish between the three main types of attention—sustained, selective, and shifting—by identifying examples of each in daily activities (e.g., sustained → finishing a puzzle; selective → ignoring chatter; shifting → changing from reading to listening).<br>Demonstrate strategies to strengthen attention through short practice tasks that involve goal-setting, minimizing distractions, or refocusing after mind-wandering (e.g., “I noticed my mind drifted, so I looked back at my task”).<br>Observe and describe how personal factors (energy, interest, environment) influence their own and others’ ability to stay focused (e.g., noticing it’s harder to pay attention when tired or when the room is noisy).<br>Apply attention-awareness skills by adjusting their workspace or behavior to support better focus for themselves and classmates (e.g., choosing a quiet corner, giving others space to concentrate). |
| **Lesson 1: Attention – the Mind’s Spotlight** | Lesson 1: Attention – the Mind’s Spotlight<br>This lesson introduces attention as the mind’s spotlight—the ability to shine focus on one thing while ignoring others. Just as a spotlight on a stage helps the audience see the most important part of the play, attention helps the mind pick out what matters from all the sights, sounds, and feelings around us.<br>Children learn that without attention, the mind’s “storage box” (memory) and “messenger” (feelings) cannot work as well, because attention is what decides what gets noticed and remembered. They explore everyday examples, such as how focusing on a teacher’s words makes it easier to learn, while being distracted makes remembering harder.<br>Through guided activities, children practice noticing what it feels like when their attention is strong versus when it wanders. The lesson emphasizes curiosity and empowerment: attention is not just something that drifts—it is a skill that can be understood, trained, and used to help learning, playing, and problem-solving. | By the end of Lesson 1, students will be able to:<br>Define attention as the mind's spotlight that selects what to notice from all available information.<br>Explain how attention determines what gets learned and remembered (e.g., "When I focus on the teacher's words, I remember them better").<br>Distinguish between strong attention (spotlight focused) and wandering attention (spotlight drifting) through self-observation.<br>Describe what it feels like when their attention is focused versus when it wanders during an activity.<br>Recognize that attention is a skill that can be understood, trained, and used to support learning and problem-solving. |
| **Lesson 2: The Different Kinds of Attention** | Lesson 2: The Different Kinds of Attention <br>This lesson introduces children to the idea that attention is not just one thing—there are different kinds of attention that the mind uses for different purposes. Sometimes we need sustained attention to keep our focus on one activity for a while, like finishing a drawing. Other times we need selective attention to block out distractions, like listening to a story even when classmates are talking nearby. And at times we need shifting attention, moving our focus quickly when something new or important happens, like stopping a game to hear an instruction.<br>Through examples and playful activities, children explore how these types of attention show up in their daily lives. They begin to see that the mind has different “spotlight modes,” each useful in its own way. The lesson emphasizes that learning to recognize and practice these kinds of attention gives children more control over how they use their mental spotlight. | By the end of Lesson 2, students will be able to:<br>Identify the three types of attention—sustained (staying focused), selective (blocking distractions), and shifting (changing focus)—and give one example of each.<br>Match attention types to appropriate situations (e.g., sustained → finishing a puzzle; selective → listening to a story despite noise; shifting → stopping play to hear an instruction).<br>Recognize which type of attention they're using during different classroom activities.<br>Explain that the mind has different "spotlight modes" for different purposes, and all are useful.<br>Demonstrate understanding by identifying which type of attention would help most in a given scenario. |
| **Lesson 3: Training Our Focus** | Lesson 3: Training Our Focus<br>This lesson shows children that attention is like a muscle—it can get stronger with practice. Just as athletes train their bodies, we can train our minds to stay focused, tune out distractions, and return attention when it wanders. Children learn that focus is not something we either “have” or “don’t have,” but a skill that can be improved through simple strategies.<br>Through guided activities, students practice techniques such as short bursts of concentration followed by breaks, using a “focus goal” to stay on task, and finding simple anchors like looking at a teacher’s eyes, listening for key words, or pointing to what they are working on. They also explore the idea of noticing when attention drifts and gently bringing it back, without judgment.<br>The lesson emphasizes empowerment: by practicing focus strategies, children build confidence that they can influence their own attention. This supports self-efficacy and resilience, helping them feel capable of handling classroom challenges, games, and everyday tasks. | By the end of Lesson 3, students will be able to:<br>Explain that attention is like a muscle that strengthens with practice, not something people either "have" or "don't have."<br>Apply at least two focus strategies during a task (e.g., setting a focus goal, using an anchor like pointing to work, taking planned breaks).<br>Demonstrate the practice of noticing when attention drifts and gently bringing it back without self-criticism.<br>Describe what helps their personal attention work better (e.g., quiet space, movement breaks, clear goals).<br>Recognize that focus improves through repeated practice and that difficulty focusing doesn't mean inability—just need for more training. |
| **Lesson 4: Attention Works Differently for Everyone** | Lesson 4: Attention Works Differently for Everyone <br>This lesson helps children recognize that while everyone uses attention, it does not look the same for all people. Some children can focus deeply for a long time, while others notice many things quickly. Some find it easy to shift their focus, while others need more time. Even within one person, attention can change depending on how tired, excited, or interested they feel.<br>Through stories, classroom activities, and reflection, students explore examples of these differences and see that they are a normal part of how minds work. The lesson emphasizes that noticing and respecting attention differences helps us learn and play together more successfully. Children also begin to reflect on what helps their own attention and how they can be considerate of others’ needs.<br>By understanding attention as both shared and varied, students strengthen empathy, self-awareness, and confidence in using strategies that support their focus. This perspective rounds out the unit by showing that attention is not only a personal skill but also a way we support each other in groups and communities. | By the end of Lesson 4, students will be able to:<br>Recognize that attention patterns vary across people (e.g., some focus deeply for long periods; others notice many things quickly).<br>Identify factors that influence attention for themselves and others (e.g., energy level, interest, noise, time of day).<br>Describe their own attention patterns and what conditions help them focus best.<br>Demonstrate respect for different attention needs by adjusting their behavior or workspace to support classmates' focus.<br>Apply self-awareness by choosing strategies or environments that match their attention needs during different tasks. |

## Unit 4: How Memory Works

|  | Description | Learning Outcomes |
|---|---|---|
| **Unit 4: How Memory Works** | This unit demystifies memory as an active mental tool rather than something that simply "happens" to us. Students learn that memory functions like a storage system that collects, keeps, and retrieves information—connecting past experiences to present needs. <br>Through four progressive lessons, children discover the information-processing model of memory (noticing/encoding → storing → retrieving), understand that attention is crucial for forming strong memories, and learn practical strategies to strengthen memory (repetition, association, storytelling, visualization). <br>The unit concludes by normalizing memory's imperfections: different people remember the same events differently based on what they noticed, and forgetting is a normal part of how memory works, not a failure. <br>This knowledge-based approach empowers students with self-efficacy ("I can help my memory work better") while building perspective-taking skills and resilience around memory's natural limitations. | By the end of this unit, students will be able to:<br>Identify memory as the mind’s tool for collecting, keeping, and bringing back information from past experiences (e.g., “My memory helps me remember my way to school or what I learned yesterday”).<br>Describe the three main stages of memory—noticing/encoding, storing, and retrieving—using simple examples from daily life (e.g., “I remember my teacher’s story because I listened carefully, kept it in my mind, and told it later”).<br>Demonstrate how attention strengthens memory by completing short tasks that compare remembering when focused versus distracted (e.g., noticing more details in a picture when concentrating).<br>Apply practical memory strategies such as repetition, association, storytelling, or visualization to improve recall (e.g., using a rhyme or image to remember a list).<br>Explain that forgetting or remembering differently is a normal part of how minds work, showing empathy toward themselves and others when memories differ (e.g., “My friend remembered the red balloon; I remembered the blue one—and that’s okay!”). |
| **Lesson 1: Memory - Our Mind’s Storage Box** | Lesson 1: Memory - Our Mind’s Storage Box<br>This lesson introduces memory as the part of the mind that stores information and brings it back when needed. Children explore memory through a simple metaphor: a “storage box” or “treasure chest” where experiences, knowledge, and skills are kept safe until they are called upon. They learn that memory is what helps us remember names, songs, places, and even how to ride a bike or play a game.<br>Through guided examples and playful activities, students begin to see memory as a reliable mental tool rather than something mysterious. They discover that memory works for everyone, even if people remember different things or in different ways. <br>The lesson emphasizes curiosity and empowerment: memory is not just something that “happens to us,” it is a function of the mind we can notice, explore, and understand. This framing lays the foundation for later lessons about how memories are formed, strengthened, and sometimes forgotten. | By the end of Lesson 1, students will be able to:<br>Define memory as the mind's tool for storing information and bringing it back when needed.<br>Identify at least four types of information memory stores (e.g., names, experiences, skills, facts).<br>Explain that memory is not mysterious—it's a function of the mind that can be observed and understood.<br>Describe how memory helps in daily life using personal examples (e.g., "Memory helps me find my classroom" or "Remember how to tie my shoes").<br>Recognize that while everyone has memory, people may remember different things or in different ways. |
| **Lesson 2: Making Memories — How We Remember Things** | Lesson 2: Making Memories — How We Remember Things<br>This lesson explores how memories are created. Children learn that remembering is not automatic; it begins when we pay attention and notice details. The mind then stores what we notice, so it can be brought back later. To make this concrete, memory is compared to “taking a snapshot” or “collecting a treasure” — what we notice carefully gets stored, while what we ignore may fade away.<br>Students discover three simple steps in the memory process: noticing (paying attention), storing (keeping it safe), and bringing back (retrieving). Activities show that paying attention helps memory stick, while distraction makes remembering harder. The lesson emphasizes that we can help our minds remember by focusing carefully and linking new information to things we already know.<br>This framing introduces the foundation of the information-processing model of memory (encoding → storage → retrieval) in a child-friendly way, while empowering children with the idea that memory is not random but shaped by how they use their attention. | By the end of Lesson 2, students will be able to:<br>Describe the three stages of memory: noticing/encoding, storing, and retrieving, using simple language or examples.<br>Explain that paying attention is the first step in forming strong memories (e.g., "What I notice carefully gets stored").<br>Demonstrate through comparison how attention affects memory by recalling more details from a focused activity than a distracted one.<br>Recognize that distraction during noticing makes later remembering harder.<br>Apply the understanding that they can help their memory by focusing carefully on what they want to remember. |
| **Lesson 3: Strengthening Memory — Tricks Our Mind Uses** | Lesson 3: Strengthening Memory — Tricks Our Mind Uses<br>This lesson shows children that memory can be strengthened with simple strategies. Just as muscles get stronger with exercise, memory grows stronger when we use certain “mind tricks.” Students discover that repeating something, making connections, turning ideas into stories, or creating mental pictures all help memory hold on more tightly.<br>Activities allow children to practice these strategies in playful, everyday ways—for example, remembering a short list by making it into a silly story, or linking a new word to something they already know. The emphasis is on empowerment: children are not stuck with their memory “as is”; they can actively help their minds remember better.<br>This lesson is grounded in developmental psychology research on mnemonic strategies and Vygotsky’s idea of “mental tools.” By learning that memory is flexible and improvable, children begin building self-efficacy: “I can do something to help my memory.” This shift from passive to active understanding makes memory feel like a skill, not just a function. | By the end of Lesson 3, students will be able to:<br>Identify at least three memory strategies: repetition, association, storytelling, and visualization.<br>Apply one memory strategy to successfully remember a short list or sequence (e.g., creating a silly story to link items).<br>Explain how each strategy helps memory work better (e.g., "Repetition gives my mind more chances to store it").<br>Demonstrate the ability to choose an appropriate memory strategy for a given task.<br>Recognize that memory can be strengthened with practice and intentional strategies, building self-efficacy ("I can help my memory work better"). |
| **Lesson 4: Memories Are Different — And That’s Okay** | Lesson 4: Memories Are Different — And That’s Okay<br>This lesson introduces children to the idea that memory is not a perfect recording device—different people may remember the same event in different ways, and sometimes we forget details altogether. Memory is constructive: our minds rebuild experiences when we recall them, which means they may come out a little differently each time.<br>Through simple examples and activities, children explore how two classmates might notice and remember different details of the same story, or how their own recollection of an event changes over time. The focus is on normalizing these differences and lapses: forgetting is not failure, and remembering differently does not mean someone is wrong. Instead, memory reflects what stood out to each person and how their mind connected the experience.<br>This lesson emphasizes perspective-taking and resilience. By understanding that memories vary, children learn to value their own and others’ perspectives without judgment, and to feel reassured that forgetting is a normal part of how memory works. | By the end of Lesson 4, students will be able to:<br>Explain that memory is constructive — it rebuilds experiences rather than recording them perfectly like a camera.<br>Recognize that two people may remember the same event differently based on what each person noticed and thought was important.<br>Provide an example from class or personal experience where classmates remembered different details of the same event.<br>Distinguish between forgetting (normal memory process) and being "wrong" or "bad at memory."<br>Demonstrate empathy and perspective-taking by accepting that different memories of the same event are all valid reflections of what stood out to each person. |

## Unit 5: Imagination and Storytelling

|  | Description | Learning Outcomes |
|---|---|---|
| **Unit 5: Imagination and Storytelling** | This unit explores imagination as a fundamental cognitive capacity—the mind's ability to create ideas, pictures, and possibilities beyond immediate perception. Students learn that imagination functions as the "mind's playground," a mental space where they can explore "what if" scenarios, combine ideas in novel ways, and draw on memory, thinking, and feelings to generate creative possibilities. Far from being mere fantasy or daydreaming, imagination emerges as a practical tool that supports learning, creativity, and everyday problem-solving.<br>Through four progressive lessons, children discover how storytelling structures imagination into shareable narratives with beginnings, middles, and endings—making abstract ideas concrete and communicable. They learn that storytelling serves as both a cognitive organizing tool (helping minds arrange thoughts and feelings coherently) and a social bridge (allowing people to share inner worlds and understand others' perspectives). The unit emphasizes imagination's practical applications: students practice generating multiple solutions to challenges, "seeing ahead" to test possibilities before acting, and recognizing that when one approach fails, imagination enables them to ask "What else could I try?"<br>The final lesson highlights the social dimension of imaginative storytelling—how sharing stories builds empathy, creates connection across differences, and strengthens communities. Students practice both expressing their own narratives and listening to others' stories, recognizing that everyone has valuable perspectives to share. By framing imagination and storytelling as interconnected mental capacities that integrate with other cognitive processes (memory provides content, thinking organizes structure, feelings guide meaning), this unit reinforces psychology as the study of how minds work while building children's confidence in their creative and communicative abilities as tools for both personal resilience and social belonging. | By the end of this unit, students will be able to:<br>Define imagination as the mind’s playground that allows people to create and explore ideas beyond what they can see or hear (e.g., “When I imagine, I can picture a flying car or think of a new game.”).<br>Describe how imagination connects with memory, thinking, and feelings to generate new ideas or stories (e.g., “I remembered our picnic and imagined what it would be like if it rained candy instead.”).<br>Demonstrate the ability to create short imaginative stories with a clear beginning, middle, and end, using pictures, movement, or spoken words to express ideas.<br>Apply imagination as a problem-solving tool by generating more than one possible solution or outcome to a given situation (e.g., “If the bridge breaks, we could build a raft instead.”).<br>Recognize and appreciate that sharing stories helps people understand each other’s thoughts and feelings, showing empathy by listening to classmates’ imaginative ideas respectfully. |
| **Lesson 1: Imagination – The Mind’s Playground** | Lesson 1: Imagination – The Mind’s Playground<br>This lesson introduces imagination as the mind’s ability to create pictures, ideas, and possibilities that are not right in front of us. Imagination is like a playground inside the mind—a space where we can try out new ideas, build stories, and explore “what if” situations safely. Children discover that imagination is not just daydreaming or fantasy; it is a powerful mental tool that supports learning, creativity, and problem-solving.<br>Through guided activities and play, students explore how imagination allows them to picture things they’ve never seen, combine ideas in new ways, and bring past experiences into new contexts. They learn that imagination is part of how everyone’s mind works, though people may imagine in different ways—through pictures, words, sounds, or feelings.<br>The lesson emphasizes that imagination connects to other parts of the mind: it uses memory to pull out ideas, thinking to organize them, and feelings to bring them to life. By recognizing imagination as a natural strength, children begin to value it as more than “pretend”—they see it as a mental capacity that enriches their everyday life. | By the end of Lesson 1, students will be able to:<br>Define imagination as the mind's ability to create pictures, ideas, and possibilities beyond immediate perception.<br>Explain that imagination is a practical mental tool supporting learning, creativity, and problem-solving, not just fantasy.<br>Describe how imagination connects with other mind parts: using memory for content, thinking for organization, and feelings for meaning.<br>Identify examples of imagination in daily life (e.g., planning a game, picturing what's inside a wrapped gift, thinking of what to build).<br>Recognize that people imagine in different ways (pictures, words, sounds, feelings) and all forms are valuable. |
| **Lesson 2: Storytelling – Turning Ideas Into Stories** | Lesson 2: Storytelling – Turning Ideas Into Stories<br>This lesson introduces storytelling as a way of shaping imagination into a clear and shareable form. While imagination allows the mind to create ideas and pictures, storytelling gives those ideas a structure—with a beginning, middle, and end—that makes them easier to understand and communicate. Stories are how people make sense of their experiences, share knowledge, and connect with others.<br>Through guided activities, students practice turning imaginative ideas into short stories, using characters, settings, and simple plots. They learn that stories can be about real events, imagined worlds, or a mix of both. The lesson highlights that storytelling is not just entertainment; it is a mental tool that organizes thoughts and feelings, helping us remember, explain, and connect.<br>Children also explore the social nature of storytelling: when we tell stories, we invite others into our imagination. This builds confidence in self-expression and appreciation for the many different stories people can create. | By the end of Lesson 2, students will be able to:<br>Explain that storytelling gives imaginative ideas structure (beginning, middle, end) that makes them shareable and understandable.<br>Create a short story with clear beginning, middle, and end using pictures, movement, or spoken words.<br>Identify the basic elements of a story: characters, setting, and simple plot.<br>Describe how storytelling serves as both a cognitive organizing tool (arranging thoughts) and a social bridge (sharing inner worlds).<br>Recognize that stories can be about real events, imagined worlds, or combinations of both. |
| **Lesson 3: Imagination Helps Us Solve Problems** | Lesson 3: Imagination Helps Us Solve Problems<br>This lesson shows children that imagination is not only for play and stories—it is also a practical tool for solving problems. Imagination allows the mind to picture different possibilities, test out ideas before acting, and create new solutions when the usual answers don’t work. Just as inventors and explorers use imagination to find new paths, children can use it in everyday situations, such as figuring out how to build a stronger block tower, finding a way to share fairly, or imagining what might happen if they try a different choice.<br>Through guided activities, students practice using imagination to “see ahead,” generating more than one possible solution to a challenge. They also explore how imagination combines with thinking and feelings: thinking organizes the plan, feelings guide what matters, and imagination creates possibilities.<br>The lesson emphasizes that imagination is a powerful mental tool for resilience. When things feel tricky or stuck, imagination gives children the ability to say, “What else could I try?” This builds confidence and a flexible approach to challenges. | By the end of Lesson 3, students will be able to:<br>Explain that imagination allows the mind to picture possibilities, test ideas mentally, and create new solutions.<br>Apply imagination to generate at least two different solutions to a given problem before choosing one.<br>Describe how imagination combines with thinking (organizing plans) and feelings (guiding what matters) during problem-solving.<br>Demonstrate "seeing ahead" by imagining what might happen if they try different approaches to a challenge.<br>Recognize imagination as a resilience tool: when stuck, asking "What else could I try?" opens new possibilities. |
| **Lesson 4: Stories Connect Us to Each Other** | Lesson 4: Stories Connect Us to Each Other <br>This lesson highlights the social power of imagination and storytelling. While imagination helps us create ideas and stories help us organize them, sharing stories allows us to connect with others. Stories let us step into someone else’s shoes, understand their feelings, and see the world from a different point of view. Children learn that stories are not just personal expressions—they are also bridges between people, cultures, and communities.<br>Through guided activities, students listen to one another’s stories and notice similarities and differences in what characters feel or do. They explore how sharing their own stories makes others understand them better, and how listening to others’ stories builds empathy and respect. The lesson emphasizes that everyone has valuable stories to tell, and that listening is just as important as speaking.<br>By seeing storytelling as both self-expression and connection, children recognize its role in building friendships, understanding differences, and creating shared meaning. This perspective shows imagination and storytelling as key tools for belonging and cooperation. | By the end of Lesson 4, students will be able to:<br>Explain that sharing stories allows people to understand each other's thoughts, feelings, and perspectives.<br>Demonstrate both expressing their own stories and listening respectfully to classmates' stories.<br>Identify how hearing someone else's story helps them see from a different point of view.<br>Describe how stories build empathy by letting us "step into someone else's shoes."<br>Recognize that everyone has valuable stories to tell, and that listening is as important as speaking for building connection. |

## Unit 6: What are Feelings?

|  | Description | Learning Outcomes |
|---|---|---|
| **Unit 6: What are Feelings?** | Building on the foundational three-part mind model, this unit provides an in-depth exploration of feelings as information systems. Students learn that feelings are valuable messengers carrying important information about themselves and their situations, not random experiences to judge as "good" or "bad." <br>Through four progressive lessons, children discover that feelings manifest in both mind and body (recognizing physical sensations like butterflies or tight shoulders), that feelings are temporary and naturally change over time (building hope and resilience), and that while all people experience feelings, expressions vary across individuals and cultures. <br>The unit emphasizes observation and curiosity—students learn to notice feelings in themselves and wonder about others' inner experiences—fostering both self-awareness and empathy. This deepened understanding of emotional experiences as understandable, temporary, and universal phenomena equips students with psychological literacy that supports self-efficacy and mental resilience. | By the end of this unit, students will be able to:<br>Identify and name a range of common feelings (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, excitement, surprise) in themselves and others, recognizing that all feelings are natural parts of human experience.<br>Describe how feelings manifest in both mind (knowing "I feel scared") and body (butterflies in stomach, tight shoulders, racing heart), locating where specific feelings appear in their own physical experience.<br>Explain that feelings function as information messengers carrying useful signals about situations (e.g., "fear warns me to be careful," "sadness tells me something matters to me"), rather than instructions that must be followed.<br>Recognize that the same situation can create different feelings in different people, and that both the universality of feelings and the diversity of emotional expression are normal patterns in how minds work.<br>Apply body awareness as an observational tool to notice and name their feelings in everyday situations, using physical sensations as early indicators of emotional states. |
| **Lesson 1: Different Feelings and What They Tell Us** | Lesson 1: Different Feelings and What They Tell Us <br>This lesson introduces children to the wide variety of feelings humans experience and the idea that each feeling carries a message. Feelings are not random or meaningless—they are like messengers that tell us something important about ourselves and our situations. Happiness might signal that something is enjoyable or valuable, sadness may show that we’ve lost something we care about, anger can signal that something feels unfair, and nervousness may warn us to be cautious or prepared.<br>Through interactive examples and classroom activities, children learn to identify and name common feelings, notice how different feelings show up in everyday life, and explore the useful messages feelings can bring. They begin to understand that while some feelings are comfortable and others uncomfortable, all feelings serve a purpose. The same event can bring out different feelings in different people, and that’s normal.<br>The lesson emphasizes that feelings are valuable sources of information, not “good” or “bad” instructions to follow. This helps children build curiosity about their inner experiences, laying the foundation for treating emotions as part of a larger psychology framework—something that can be understood, observed, and used to make sense of life. | By the end of Lesson 1, students will be able to:<br>Identify at least four common feelings (happy, sad, angry, scared, excited) using words or pictures.<br>Describe what information each feeling communicates (e.g., "Fear warns me about danger" or "Sadness tells me something important to me is gone or hurt").<br>Distinguish between comfortable and uncomfortable feelings without judging them as "good" or "bad" (e.g., recognizing that anger feels uncomfortable but isn't wrong).<br>Recognize that the same event can create different feelings for different people, sharing one example from class discussion.<br>Apply curiosity by asking "What might this feeling be telling me?" in simple reflection activities. |
| **Lesson 2: How Feelings Show Up in Our Bodies** | Lesson 2: How Feelings Show Up in Our Bodies<br>This lesson helps children understand that feelings are not only in the mind but also show up in the body. Emotions create physical signals—our bodies often react before we even find the words to describe what we feel. For example, worry might bring a tight stomach, anger might bring clenched fists, and happiness might bring a light, bouncy energy. These body signals are part of how feelings send us messages, helping us notice and respond to what is happening inside and around us.<br>Through guided activities, students practice identifying where and how different feelings appear in their bodies. They discover that while many people share common physical cues, each person’s body signals can also be unique. The lesson emphasizes that paying attention to body signals is a powerful tool: noticing these cues can help us recognize our feelings early and understand them better. This strengthens children’s ability to tune into themselves and builds awareness that mind and body work together. | By the end of Lesson 2, students will be able to:<br>Locate where specific feelings appear in their body by pointing to or naming the physical location (e.g., butterflies in stomach for nervous, warmth in chest for happy).<br>Match common body sensations to corresponding feelings (e.g., tight shoulders → worried, clenched fists → angry, bouncy energy → excited).<br>Distinguish between the mental experience of feeling ("knowing I feel scared") and the physical experience ("my heart beats fast").<br>Recognize that while many people share common physical cues for feelings, each person's body signals can be unique.<br>Demonstrate body awareness by noticing and naming at least one physical sensation during a guided feeling-identification activity. |
| **Lesson 3: Feelings Change (And That's Normal)** | Lesson 3: Feelings Change (And That's Normal)<br>This lesson introduces the idea that feelings are not fixed—they shift and change over time. Just as the weather can move from sunny to rainy and back again, our feelings can rise, fade, or transform depending on what is happening around us and inside us. Children learn that it is normal for feelings to be temporary and that even strong or uncomfortable feelings will not last forever.<br>Through stories and simple activities, students explore examples of how feelings can change in different situations: excitement may turn into disappointment, sadness may ease when comforted, or nervousness may settle once a task begins. They also discover that people may move through feelings at different speeds—some quickly, others more slowly—and both are normal. The lesson emphasizes that noticing feelings change gives us hope and perspective: tricky feelings can pass, and new feelings will always come. This awareness helps children build resilience by understanding feelings as moving experiences rather than permanent states. | By the end of Lesson 3, students will be able to:<br>Explain that feelings are temporary and change over time, using weather as a concrete analogy (e.g., "Feelings can move from sad to calm, like weather from rainy to sunny").<br>Identify examples of how feelings changed in a story or personal experience (e.g., "I felt nervous before the assembly, then excited during it, then tired after").<br>Recognize that people move through feelings at different speeds—some quickly, others more slowly—and both patterns are normal.<br>Apply the understanding that uncomfortable feelings will pass by recalling a time when a difficult feeling eventually changed.<br>Describe what helps feelings change (e.g., time passing, comfort from others, situation changing, body calming down). |
| **Lesson 4: Everyone Has Feelings (Even When They Look Different)** | Lesson 4: Everyone Has Feelings (Even When They Look Different)<br>This lesson highlights that all people experience feelings, but the way they show or express them can look different. Some children may laugh when they feel nervous, others may go quiet when they are sad, and some may show anger with loud words while others keep it inside. Feelings are universal, but expressions are personal.<br>Through stories, role-play, and observation, children explore how the same feeling can appear in different ways depending on the person, the situation, or the culture. They learn to look beyond surface behavior and practice curiosity: “What might that person be feeling?” This builds empathy and helps children understand that while feelings are shared human experiences, people may not always show them in the same way.<br>The lesson emphasizes that recognizing the universality of feelings fosters connection—we all have them—while respecting differences in expression encourages kindness and patience. Children begin to see that understanding others’ feelings is a key part of living and learning together. | By the end of Lesson 4, students will be able to:<br>Recognize that all people experience feelings, even when their expressions look different.<br>Distinguish between internal feelings (universal) and external expressions (varied) by providing examples (e.g., "Some people cry when sad; others go quiet").<br>Identify at least two different ways the same feeling might be expressed by different people or in different cultures.<br>Apply curiosity by asking "What might that person be feeling?" when observing behavior rather than assuming they know.<br>Demonstrate empathy by acknowledging that classmates' different expressions of feelings are all valid ways of experiencing emotions. |

## Unit 7: Family and Friendship Dynamics

|  | Description | Learning Outcomes |
|---|---|---|
| **Unit 7: Family and Friendship Dynamics** | This unit shifts from individual cognitive processes to the social systems that shape children's psychological development. Students learn that families function as their "first teams"—foundational social structures where they experience roles, responsibilities, and cooperation, with members contributing differently toward shared well-being. Through exploring what makes friendships strong (kindness, trust, sharing, listening, respect), children discover that friendship is a learnable skill rather than something that simply "happens."<br>The unit normalizes relationship challenges by teaching that disagreements and conflicts are natural parts of family and friendship life. What matters is learning to work through problems together using strategies like listening, taking turns, compromising, and asking for help when needed—reframing conflict as an opportunity to strengthen relationships through cooperative problem-solving. The final lesson celebrates diversity in both family structures and friendship patterns, emphasizing that what makes relationships strong is the quality of care, respect, and support within them, not their external form.<br>By examining relationships as systems that can be understood and skillfully navigated, this unit treats students as objective learners gaining knowledge about how human connection works. Understanding relationship dynamics builds self-efficacy ("I can be a good friend and team member") and resilience ("I can handle conflicts and differences"), while fostering empathy and inclusivity as foundations for healthy social development. | By the end of this unit, students will be able to:<br>Identify the family as a team system in which members have different roles, responsibilities, and ways of helping one another (e.g., “My job is to feed the pet; my mom cooks; my brother sets the table.”).<br>Describe the qualities of strong friendships—such as kindness, trust, sharing, listening, and respect—by giving real or story-based examples (e.g., “A good friend listens when I talk and lets me play too.”).<br>Demonstrate cooperative and caring behaviors that build or maintain friendships, including taking turns, helping, and using kind words during shared tasks or games.<br>Recognize and explain that disagreements and conflicts are normal, and apply simple strategies—listening, compromising, or asking for help—to solve them peacefully (e.g., “We both wanted the red block, so we took turns.”).<br>Compare different family and friendship patterns to appreciate diversity, showing empathy and inclusion toward classmates whose relationships or families look different (e.g., “Some friends live with grandparents; others have two homes—and all families care in their own ways.”). |
| **Lesson 1: Families Are Our First Teams** | Lesson 1: Families Are Our First Teams<br>This lesson introduces the idea of family as a child’s first “team.” Families are where children first learn about roles, responsibilities, and cooperation—how people support each other, share tasks, and work together. Just as players on a team each have a part to play, family members contribute in different ways to help the group function.<br>Children explore examples of teamwork at home: parents or caregivers providing care, siblings sharing play or chores, and children themselves helping with small responsibilities. The lesson emphasizes that while every family looks different, what makes a family a “team” is the way members care for one another and work toward shared well-being.<br>This perspective helps children see family not just as people they live with, but as an important social system that shapes how they think, feel, and act. It also lays the foundation for understanding other kinds of teamwork—among friends, classmates, and communities—later in the curriculum. | By the end of Lesson 1, students will be able to:<br>Define family as a team system where members have different roles and work together toward shared well-being.<br>Identify at least three examples of teamwork within their family (e.g., sharing chores, caring for each other, solving problems together).<br>Describe how family members contribute in different ways, just as teammates have different positions.<br>Recognize that while every family looks different, what makes families "teams" is how members care for and support one another.<br>Explain how family experiences teach cooperation skills used in other contexts (school, friendships, community). |
| **Lesson 2: What Makes a Good Friend** | Lesson 2: What Makes a Good Friend <br>This lesson explores the qualities that make friendships strong and lasting. Children learn that friends are not just playmates but people we can trust, share with, and support. A good friend shows kindness, listens, takes turns, and respects feelings. Friendship is built on give-and-take: sometimes we lead, sometimes we follow, and both roles are important.<br>Through stories, role-play, and discussion, students identify the qualities of good friendship and contrast them with behaviors that can make friendships difficult, such as excluding others or not keeping promises. They practice recognizing how positive friendship behaviors—kind words, fairness, encouragement—make relationships more fun and supportive.<br>The lesson emphasizes that everyone has the power to be a good friend, and that friendship is a skill that grows through practice. By understanding the qualities of strong friendships, children build both self-awareness and empathy, preparing them for cooperative play and teamwork. | By the end of Lesson 2, students will be able to:<br>Identify at least four qualities that make friendships strong: kindness, listening, trust, sharing, taking turns, and respect.<br>Distinguish between behaviors that build friendships (e.g., including others, keeping promises) and behaviors that weaken them (e.g., excluding, not listening).<br>Describe how friendship involves give-and-take, with different people leading or following at different times.<br>Apply friendship skills by demonstrating kind words, fairness, or encouragement during a classroom activity.<br>Recognize that being a good friend is a skill that improves with practice, not something people simply "are" or "aren't." |
| **Lesson 3: Solving Problems Together** | Lesson 3: Solving Problems Together<br>This lesson introduces children to the idea that disagreements and conflicts are a normal part of family and friendship life. What matters is not avoiding problems but learning how to work through them together. Children discover that problem-solving in relationships involves listening, sharing perspectives, and finding fair solutions that respect everyone’s needs.<br>Through role-play and guided activities, students practice simple strategies for handling common conflicts, such as taking turns, compromising, or asking for help from a trusted adult. They learn that strong relationships are not about always agreeing, but about using respectful communication and cooperation to keep the relationship healthy.<br>The lesson emphasizes that problem-solving is a skill, not a sign of weakness. When families and friends solve problems together, it strengthens trust and connection. By practicing these skills, children build resilience and confidence that they can handle tricky situations in ways that help relationships grow stronger. | By the end of Lesson 3, students will be able to:<br>Explain that disagreements and conflicts are normal in families and friendships, not signs that relationships are failing.<br>Identify at least three strategies for working through conflicts: listening to all perspectives, compromising, taking turns, or asking for help.<br>Demonstrate conflict resolution by practicing the sequence: state the problem → listen to each person → find a fair solution → agree on a plan.<br>Distinguish between productive problem-solving (respectful communication, cooperation) and unproductive patterns (ignoring, blaming, refusing to compromise).<br>Recognize that solving problems together strengthens relationships by building trust and connection. |
| **Lesson 4: Families and Friendships Come in Many Forms** | Lesson 4: Families and Friendships Come in Many Forms <br>This lesson helps children understand that while all families and friendships are important, they can look very different. Some families are large, others small; some include grandparents, aunts, or uncles living together, while others are just parents and children. Friendships, too, can vary—some children have many friends, others prefer a few close ones, and some build friendships through shared activities like sports, art, or games.<br>Through stories and classroom discussions, students explore examples of diverse family structures and different ways friendships are formed. They learn that what matters most is not how a family or friendship looks on the outside but the care, respect, and support within it.<br>The lesson emphasizes inclusion and empathy: everyone’s family and friendship experiences are valid, and respecting these differences makes communities stronger. By recognizing diversity in relationships, children expand their perspective beyond their immediate circles and begin to see belonging as something that takes many forms. | By the end of Lesson 4, students will be able to:<br>Identify examples of diverse family structures (e.g., different sizes, living arrangements, cultural patterns).<br>Recognize that friendships also vary in form (many friends vs. few close friends, shared activities vs. shared interests).<br>Explain that what matters most in families and friendships is the quality of care, respect, and support, not the external structure.<br>Demonstrate inclusion and empathy by respecting classmates' different family and friendship experiences.<br>Apply perspective-taking by recognizing that all family and friendship patterns are valid when they provide care and connection. |

## Unit 8: Problem-Solving Basics

|  | Description | Learning Outcomes |
|---|---|---|
| **Unit 8: Problem-Solving Basics** | This unit frames problems as normal parts of life and opportunities for the mind to work. Students learn that problems are not “bad” or shameful; they are puzzles that invite the mind’s tools—thinking, feeling, and doing—to find a way forward. Using real stories and classroom examples, children notice that problems come in different sizes (small everyday hassles, medium disagreements, larger challenges) and that everyone—kids and adults—faces them.<br>Students practice a clear, reliable four-step model: Stop and Notice → Think of Options → Choose One → Try It Out. Through role-play and guided tasks, they see how following steps turns confusion into action. They also discover that most problems allow more than one possible solution; imagination and flexible thinking help them generate multiple options, compare them, and select a good fit.<br>When first attempts don’t work, children learn to persist, adjust, and try again, and to recognize help-seeking as a smart strategy rather than a weakness. Family, friends, and teachers can offer ideas or support, making problem-solving a cooperative process. By the end of the unit, students understand that solving problems means thinking carefully before acting, choosing and testing solutions, and refining with persistence and help. This builds self-efficacy (“I can handle challenges”) and prepares them for Unit 9, where they examine how their chosen actions create effects for themselves, others, and their environment. | By the end of this unit, students will be able to:<br>Identify everyday situations that represent different sizes or types of problems (e.g., small: forgetting a pencil; medium: sharing a toy; larger: feeling nervous before a show).<br>Describe the four-step problem-solving model — Stop and Notice → Think of Options → Choose One → Try It Out — and explain what each step helps the mind do (e.g., Stop = notice clearly; Think = imagine choices).<br>Demonstrate the ability to generate more than one possible solution to a simple problem and compare which might work best, showing flexible and creative thinking.<br>Apply persistence and help-seeking strategies when an initial solution doesn’t work, by trying another idea or asking someone for advice or support.<br>Reflect and discuss how following structured steps and cooperating with others makes problem-solving feel easier and more successful for themselves and classmates. |
| **Lesson 1: Problems Are Part of Life** | Lesson 1: Problems Are Part of Life<br>This lesson introduces the idea that problems are a normal part of everyday life. Children learn that problems are not “bad” or something to be ashamed of—they are simply challenges that the mind and body can work to solve. Just as puzzles in games are meant to be figured out, real-life problems give us opportunities to think, choose, and grow.<br>Through stories, classroom examples, and guided reflection, students explore different types of problems: small (forgetting a pencil), medium (sharing a toy), and larger (feeling nervous about a performance). They begin to see that everyone—children and adults alike—faces problems, and that problems can be approached instead of avoided.<br>The lesson emphasizes resilience: problems are not signs of weakness but chances to use the mind’s tools—thinking, feeling, and doing—to find a way forward. By normalizing problems, children develop confidence that they are capable of handling challenges with support and effort. | By the end of Lesson 1, students will be able to:<br>Define problems as normal challenges that give minds opportunities to work, not signs of failure or shame.<br>Categorize problems by size: small (everyday hassles), medium (disagreements), and larger (more complex challenges).<br>Recognize that everyone—children and adults—faces problems regularly.<br>Explain that problems are like puzzles meant to be figured out using the mind's tools (thinking, feeling, doing).<br>Demonstrate a shift in perspective by identifying a recent problem as a chance to practice problem-solving rather than something "bad." |
| **Lesson 2: Steps for Solving Problems** | Lesson 2: Steps for Solving Problems<br>This lesson introduces children to a simple, structured framework for solving problems. Instead of reacting automatically or feeling stuck, the mind can follow clear steps to move forward. A child-friendly model might include four steps:<br>Stop and Notice – What is the problem?<br>Think of Options – What could I do?<br>Choose One – Which option seems best?<br>Try It Out – See what happens.<br>Through guided practice and role-play, students learn to apply these steps to small, familiar problems, such as disagreements over a toy or deciding how to finish a classroom task. They discover that having a process helps them feel calmer and more confident, even when the situation is tricky.<br>The lesson emphasizes that problem-solving is not about always getting the perfect answer the first time; it is about having a plan to try, adjust, and learn from. By practicing the steps, children begin to internalize a reliable mental framework that they can use in both school and home life. | By the end of Lesson 2, students will be able to:<br>Identify the four steps of problem-solving: Stop and Notice → Think of Options → Choose One → Try It Out.<br>Explain what each step helps the mind do (e.g., Stop = notice clearly; Think = imagine choices; Choose = pick best fit; Try = see what happens).<br>Apply the four-step model to solve a simple, familiar problem during role-play or guided practice.<br>Describe how following a process makes problem-solving feel less overwhelming and more manageable.<br>Recognize that problem-solving isn't about finding the perfect answer immediately—it's about having a plan to try, adjust, and learn. |
| **Lesson 3: Thinking of Different Solutions** | Lesson 3: Thinking of Different Solutions<br>This lesson highlights that most problems do not have only one answer—there are often many possible solutions. Imagination and flexible thinking help the mind explore options, rather than getting stuck on a single approach. By generating different solutions, children can compare choices, pick the one that fits best, and feel more confident in their ability to handle challenges.<br>Through games and guided activities, students practice brainstorming multiple ways to solve simple problems, such as deciding how to share limited supplies or choosing different routes in a puzzle game. They explore the idea that sometimes the first solution works, but sometimes another idea might be better. The lesson emphasizes that creativity is part of problem-solving, and trying out new ideas is a strength, not a weakness.<br>By normalizing the idea that there is often more than one “right” way, children develop flexibility, curiosity, and persistence—qualities that prepare them to face bigger challenges later. | By the end of Lesson 3, students will be able to:<br>Explain that most problems have multiple possible solutions, not just one "right" answer.<br>Generate at least three different solutions to a given problem through brainstorming.<br>Compare solutions by considering which might work best for the specific situation.<br>Demonstrate flexible thinking by remaining open to trying different approaches rather than insisting on a single solution.<br>Apply creativity as part of problem-solving, recognizing that trying new ideas is a strength. |
| **Lesson 4: Keep Trying and Ask for Help** | Lesson 4: Keep Trying and Ask for Help<br>This lesson teaches children that problem-solving is rarely perfect the first time. Sometimes a chosen solution doesn’t work as expected—and that’s normal. What matters is persistence: trying again with a different approach, instead of giving up. Children also learn that asking for help is not a sign of weakness but a smart strategy. Family members, friends, and teachers can provide new ideas, guidance, or support when problems feel too big to handle alone.<br>Through stories, role-play, and discussion, students explore examples of persistence (e.g., practicing a new skill until it gets easier) and help-seeking (e.g., asking a classmate to explain directions or a parent to help fix something). They begin to see that problem-solving is a shared process: we use our own tools but also rely on others when needed.<br>The lesson emphasizes resilience and community: strong problem-solvers don’t stop at the first obstacle, and they know how to seek help respectfully and effectively. This perspective empowers children to feel capable and supported in the face of challenges. | By the end of Lesson 4, students will be able to:<br>Explain that solutions don't always work the first time, and persistence means trying again with adjustments.<br>Distinguish between giving up (stopping effort) and persisting (trying a different approach).<br>Identify when asking for help is a smart strategy rather than a sign of weakness.<br>Demonstrate help-seeking by respectfully asking a classmate, teacher, or family member for ideas or support during a problem-solving activity.<br>Recognize that problem-solving is often a shared process where we use our own tools and also rely on others' perspectives. |

## Unit 9: Our Actions and Impact

|  | Description | Learning Outcomes |
|---|---|---|
| **Unit 9: Our Actions and Impact** | This unit introduces actions as part of a cause-and-effect system that shapes what happens in our lives and surroundings. Students learn that every action produces an effect, like ripples in water—some appear right away, others unfold over time. They explore everyday examples showing how their choices influence themselves, other people, and the environment, building awareness that actions matter because they set things in motion.<br>As the lessons progress, children discover that small choices can lead to big outcomes and that they can guide their actions intentionally toward helpful results. Through stories, examples, and role-play, they compare helpful and unhelpful behaviors, practice choosing actions that support kindness, fairness, and care, and recognize that responsibility means directing their choices thoughtfully rather than reacting automatically.<br>Finally, students learn that mistakes are part of learning. When actions don’t bring the results they hoped for, they practice noticing what happened, making things right, and trying again. By linking actions, choices, and consequences, this unit builds self-awareness, social responsibility, and resilience—helping children see that their everyday decisions have real power to shape their world. | By the end of this unit, students will be able to:<br>Identify everyday examples of cause and effect by describing what happens after certain actions (e.g., “When I help my friend, they smile”; “When I forget to water a plant, it droops”).<br>Describe how small, repeated choices can create larger patterns of outcomes for themselves, others, or the environment (e.g., “When I keep my desk tidy every day, it stays clean”).<br>Distinguish between helpful and unhelpful actions by comparing their effects on people’s feelings or shared spaces (e.g., helping → makes others happy; ignoring → hurts feelings).<br>Apply the idea of responsibility by choosing and explaining actions that lead to positive results during classroom activities or role-play (e.g., choosing to include others, share materials, or clean up together).<br>Reflect on and demonstrate how to learn from mistakes by noticing an unintended effect, making it right, and trying again with a better choice (e.g., apologizing after upsetting someone and changing behavior next time). |
| **Lesson 1: Every Action Has an Effect** | Lesson 1: Every Action Has an Effect <br>This lesson introduces children to the foundational idea that every action creates an effect. Actions are like pebbles dropped into water—they make ripples that spread outward. Sometimes the effect is immediate, like helping a classmate pick up books and seeing them smile. Other times the effect takes longer, like remembering to water a plant and watching it grow over days.<br>Through guided activities, children notice cause-and-effect links between their actions and outcomes for themselves, others, and their surroundings. They explore both positive and negative examples: sharing can build friendship, while leaving someone out can hurt feelings. The lesson emphasizes that actions matter because they set things in motion, shaping what happens next.<br>By seeing actions as connected to outcomes, children begin to understand responsibility—not as blame, but as awareness of how their choices influence the world. This perspective lays the groundwork for building self-efficacy: if their actions create effects, then they also have the power to choose actions that lead to helpful results. | By the end of Lesson 1, students will be able to:<br>Define cause and effect as the relationship where actions create outcomes, like ripples in water.<br>Identify at least four examples of action-effect pairs from daily life (e.g., helping → friend smiles; forgetting to water plant → plant droops).<br>Distinguish between immediate effects (happen right away) and delayed effects (unfold over time).<br>Explain how their actions influence themselves, other people, and their environment.<br>Recognize that understanding action-effect connections means they have power to shape outcomes through their choices. |
| **Lesson 2: Small Choices Make a Big Difference** | Lesson 2: Small Choices Make a Big Difference <br>This lesson helps children understand that not all impacts come from big, dramatic actions—many of the most important changes start with small choices. Saying “thank you,” including a classmate in a game, or turning off the tap while brushing teeth may seem tiny, but these actions add up to create meaningful effects for ourselves, others, and the environment.<br>Through stories, examples, and simple activities, students explore how repeated small actions build patterns: kindness can strengthen friendships, responsibility can build trust, and wasteful habits can harm shared spaces. They learn that every choice is like planting a seed—it may be small, but over time it grows into something larger.<br>The lesson emphasizes empowerment: children may feel small in a big world, but their everyday actions carry real weight. By seeing how small choices accumulate, they gain confidence that they can make a difference in their families, classrooms, and communities. | By the end of Lesson 2, students will be able to:<br>Explain that repeated small actions accumulate to create larger patterns and outcomes.<br>Provide examples of how small daily choices build into bigger effects (e.g., tidying daily → clean space; kind words daily → strong friendships).<br>Compare the cumulative effects of helpful small actions versus unhelpful ones.<br>Recognize that even though they may feel small, their everyday choices carry real weight.<br>Apply the understanding that small actions matter by choosing at least one helpful daily behavior and tracking its effects. |
| **Lesson 3: Choosing Helpful Actions** | Lesson 3: Choosing Helpful Actions <br>Children learn that while every action creates effects, they can choose actions intentionally based on desired outcomes. The lesson distinguishes helpful actions (supporting themselves, others, and environment) from unhelpful ones (creating problems or harm) through cause-effect analysis rather than moral judgment. Students practice the thinking sequence: "What do I want to happen?" → "Which action will help that happen?" → "I choose that one."<br>Through role-play and concrete scenarios, children compare action-effect pairs in familiar contexts: sharing versus grabbing materials, kind versus mean words, including versus excluding classmates. They discover patterns showing how certain actions consistently produce helpful outcomes (cooperation builds friendships, responsibility earns trust) while others create problems (exclusion causes hurt, carelessness creates extra work). Activities guide students to predict consequences before acting and select actions strategically.<br>This integrates the mind's three parts: Thinking predicts consequences, Feeling provides information about what matters to self and others, and Doing executes the chosen action. The approach aligns with self-determination theory—children develop competence and autonomy not from being told they're "good," but from understanding causal mechanisms linking choices to effects.<br>The lesson normalizes that choosing helpful actions isn't always easy when frustrated or tired, but that the thinking-before-acting pattern strengthens with practice. This builds self-efficacy through genuine control over outcomes rather than mere compliance, supporting executive function development through scaffolded practice. | By the end of Lesson 3, students will be able to:<br>Distinguish between helpful actions (supporting self, others, environment) and unhelpful actions (creating problems) by analyzing their effects.<br>Apply the thinking sequence: "What do I want to happen?" → "Which action will help that happen?" → "I choose that one."<br>Predict likely effects of different action choices before deciding which to take.<br>Demonstrate intentional action selection during role-play by explaining why they chose a particular behavior.<br>Recognize patterns showing how certain actions consistently produce helpful outcomes (cooperation, responsibility, kindness) while others create problems. |
| **Lesson 4: Learning from Mistakes** | Lesson 4: Learning from Mistakes <br>Mistakes are reframed as natural feedback within the action-effect system rather than failures requiring shame. When actions produce unexpected or unwanted effects, the resulting information helps minds learn and adjust. Students practice the pattern: Action → Unwanted Effect → Notice What Happened → Make It Right → Try Differently Next Time, using age-appropriate examples like accidentally knocking over blocks, helping rebuild them, and moving carefully afterward.<br>Children distinguish between accidents (unintended effects) and poor choices (intended actions creating problems), recognizing both as learning opportunities. Making things right involves acknowledging what happened, repairing effects when possible, and changing future patterns—aligning with restorative justice principles. Students practice meaningful apologies connected to specific actions and effects, contrasting these with empty apologies or excuses.<br>The lesson normalizes mistakes as universal experiences where actions and outcomes didn't match, providing adjustment information. This growth mindset approach (Dweck) builds resilience by framing setbacks as learning moments rather than evidence of inadequacy. Activities analyze scenarios through "What was the action? What was the effect? What could work differently?" developing metacognitive awareness.<br>Ending Unit 9 with learning from mistakes completes the action-impact framework: actions create effects (L1), small actions accumulate (L2), strategic action selection is possible (L3), and mismatches provide learning opportunities (L4). This prepares students to apply individual action-awareness skills in Unit 10's collaborative contexts, building confidence that struggle leads to competence. | By the end of Lesson 4, students will be able to:<br>Define mistakes as situations where actions produced unintended or unwanted effects, providing learning information rather than representing failure.<br>Distinguish between accidents (unintended effects) and poor choices (actions that predictably create problems), recognizing both as learning opportunities.<br>Apply the mistake-learning sequence: Action → Unwanted Effect → Notice What Happened → Make It Right → Try Differently Next Time.<br>Demonstrate making things right by practicing meaningful apologies connected to specific actions and effects.<br>Explain how mistakes help minds learn and adjust, supporting growth rather than indicating inadequacy. |

## Unit 10: Teamwork and Cooperation

|  | Description | Learning Outcomes |
|---|---|---|
| **Unit 10: Teamwork and Cooperation** | This unit explores cooperation as the process of combining efforts with others to achieve shared goals that would be difficult or impossible alone. Students learn that teamwork requires intentional choices—listening carefully, taking turns, sharing roles, and respecting others—rather than simply working in proximity. Through collaborative activities and games, children discover that strong teams distribute responsibility so everyone contributes meaningfully, recognizing that different roles (leading, organizing, creating, supporting) are all valuable and necessary for success.<br>The unit normalizes challenges within teamwork by teaching that disagreements, mistakes, and conflicts are natural parts of collaboration. What distinguishes strong teams is not the absence of problems but the ability to solve them cooperatively through listening, compromising, and making group decisions. Students practice strategies for working through team challenges, discovering that addressing problems together builds trust, respect, and resilience rather than weakening the group.<br>The final lesson emphasizes celebrating collective achievements, teaching that success belongs to the group rather than individuals. Recognition and encouragement strengthen team spirit, building pride, connection, and belonging among members. By framing celebration as appreciation for effort and growth rather than "winning," the unit reinforces that cooperation itself is rewarding and meaningful. <br>This capstone unit integrates the year's learning—applying thinking (generating solutions), feeling (recognizing emotions in self and others), and doing (choosing helpful actions)—within social contexts, completing the curriculum's progression from individual psychological processes to collaborative social systems. Students finish Grade 1 with confidence in both their individual capabilities and their value as contributing team members in families, classrooms, and communities. | By the end of this unit, students will be able to:<br>Identify the essential components of teamwork by distinguishing between groups working in proximity versus groups cooperating toward shared goals (e.g., recognizing that sitting near classmates during independent work is different from coordinating roles to build a block tower together).<br>Demonstrate cooperative behaviors that strengthen team functioning by taking turns, listening to others' ideas, and contributing meaningfully to assigned roles during structured group activities (e.g., in a classroom cleanup task, waiting for turn to speak during planning, accepting the role of "materials organizer," and completing that responsibility).<br>Apply conflict-resolution strategies when team challenges arise by listening to different perspectives, proposing compromises, and making group decisions that allow work to continue (e.g., when two teammates want the same role, suggesting they switch halfway through or finding a related role that uses similar skills).<br>Recognize that different team roles contribute equally to collective success by describing how various functions—leading, organizing, creating, supporting—are each necessary and valuable (e.g., explaining that "the idea person, the builder, and the person who gets materials all helped us finish the project").<br>Explain how celebrating group achievements builds team connection by describing the difference between individual recognition ("I won") and collective celebration ("we worked together and succeeded"), using examples from classroom team experiences to show how shared recognition strengthens belonging and motivation for future cooperation. |
| **Lesson 1: Working Together Toward a Goal** | Lesson 1: Working Together Toward a Goal<br>This lesson introduces teamwork as the process of joining efforts with others to achieve something that no one person could do as easily alone. Children discover that cooperation means combining strengths—sharing ideas, helping hands, and encouragement—to reach a shared goal. Just as in a sports team, orchestra, or building project, teamwork is about more than individual effort; it is about coordination and support.<br>Through classroom games and collaborative activities, students experience how working together changes what is possible. They notice that tasks become faster, easier, or more enjoyable when people cooperate. The lesson also highlights that teamwork requires intentional choices: listening, respecting others, and committing to the group’s goal.<br>By recognizing teamwork as a skill, children begin to see themselves not only as independent problem-solvers but also as valuable members of groups. This perspective builds both competence and belonging—key developmental needs at this age. | By the end of Lesson 1, students will be able to:<br>Define teamwork as combining efforts with others to achieve what would be difficult or impossible alone.<br>Identify examples of how cooperation changes what's possible (e.g., tasks become faster, easier, or more enjoyable).<br>Describe the intentional choices teamwork requires: listening, respecting others, and committing to the group's goal.<br>Distinguish between working near others (proximity) and working with others (coordination and shared purpose).<br>Recognize themselves as valuable team members who contribute to group success. |
| **Lesson 2: Listening and Sharing Roles** | Lesson 2: Listening and Sharing Roles<br>This lesson focuses on the core skills that make teamwork possible: listening carefully to others, taking turns, and sharing roles so that everyone contributes. Children learn that a strong team is not made up of one person doing everything but of many people each playing a part. Listening shows respect, sharing roles spreads responsibility, and turn-taking ensures fairness.<br>Through cooperative games and group tasks, students experience how teamwork breaks down when people don’t listen or when one person takes over, compared to how smoothly it works when everyone participates. They also learn that different roles are valuable—some lead, some organize, some create, some support—and that all are needed for success.<br>The lesson emphasizes respect and inclusion: when everyone has a role, each member feels important, and the team is stronger. By practicing these skills, children build the foundation for fair play, collaboration in learning, and confidence in group settings. | By the end of Lesson 2, students will be able to:<br>Explain that strong teams distribute responsibility so everyone contributes, rather than one person doing everything.<br>Demonstrate listening carefully to others' ideas and taking turns during a cooperative activity.<br>Identify different valuable roles in teamwork: leading, organizing, creating, supporting, and explain why all are necessary.<br>Compare how teamwork breaks down when people don't listen or someone takes over versus how smoothly it works with fair participation.<br>Apply turn-taking and role-sharing to ensure all team members feel important and valued. |
| **Lesson 3: Solving Problems as a Team** | Lesson 3: Solving Problems as a Team<br>This lesson helps children understand that teamwork does not mean everything always runs smoothly—disagreements, mistakes, and challenges are a natural part of working together. What makes a team strong is not the absence of problems, but the ability to solve them cooperatively.<br>Through role-play and group activities, students practice strategies for team problem-solving: listening to each person’s idea, sharing feelings respectfully, finding compromises, and agreeing on a plan. They notice that when team members argue without listening, tasks stall, but when they cooperate to find solutions, the team can move forward stronger than before.<br>The lesson emphasizes that solving problems as a team builds trust, respect, and resilience. Children begin to see teamwork not as “perfect harmony” but as a process where challenges are met with shared effort and communication. | By the end of Lesson 3, students will be able to:<br>Explain that disagreements and challenges are normal in teamwork; strong teams solve them cooperatively rather than avoiding them.<br>Apply team problem-solving strategies: listening to all ideas, sharing feelings respectfully, finding compromises, and agreeing on plans.<br>Distinguish between unproductive conflict patterns (arguing without listening) and productive ones (cooperative solution-finding).<br>Demonstrate respectful communication during a team challenge or role-play.<br>Recognize that solving problems together builds team trust, respect, and resilience. |
| **Lesson 4: Celebrating What We Achieve Together** | Lesson 4: Celebrating What We Achieve Together <br>This lesson emphasizes the importance of recognizing and celebrating what teams accomplish. Children learn that success is not only about individual effort but about the group’s shared work—listening, cooperating, and supporting each other along the way. Just as sports teams cheer after a game or a class claps for a group presentation, celebrating achievements strengthens the sense of belonging and pride in what was built together.<br>Through classroom activities, students experience how recognition and encouragement boost team spirit. They reflect on the feelings of contributing to a group success—pride, connection, and joy—and notice how acknowledging others’ efforts makes everyone feel valued. The lesson highlights that celebration is not about winning or being “the best,” but about appreciating teamwork, effort, and growth.<br>By ending the unit with celebration, children internalize that cooperation is rewarding, meaningful, and something to look forward to. This builds motivation to bring teamwork skills into future challenges at school, home, and community. | By the end of Lesson 4, students will be able to:<br>Explain that celebrating collective achievements strengthens team spirit, belonging, and pride in shared work.<br>Identify how recognition and encouragement affect team members' feelings and motivation.<br>Distinguish between celebrating "winning" or "being best" versus celebrating teamwork, effort, and growth.<br>Demonstrate appreciation for team members' contributions by acknowledging specific helpful actions or behaviors.<br>Recognize that cooperation itself is rewarding and meaningful, making future teamwork something to anticipate positively. |
