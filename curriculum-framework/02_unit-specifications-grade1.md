| Attention  | spotlight---the active      | able to:**                |
| and Focus  | process that determines     |                           |
|            | what we notice, learn, and  | 1.  **Define** attention  |
|            | remember. Students discover |     as the mind's         |
|            | that attention isn\'t a     |     "spotlight" that      |
|            | single ability but comes in |     helps select what to  |
|            | different forms: sustained  |     notice, learn, and    |
|            | attention (staying focused  |     remember (e.g., "When |
|            | on one task), selective     |     I point my mind's     |
|            | attention (tuning out       |     light at something, I |

|            | Through four progressive    |     between the three     |
|            | lessons, children learn     |     main types of         |
|            | that attention is like a    |                           |
|            | muscle that can be trained  |  attention---**sustained, |
|            | and strengthened through    |     selective,** and      |
|            | practice, using strategies  |     **shifting**---by     |
|            | such as setting focus       |     **identifying         |
|            | goals, minimizing           |     examples** of each in |
|            | distractions, and gently    |     daily activities      |
|            | bringing attention back     |     (e.g., sustained →    |
|            | when it wanders.            |     finishing a puzzle;   |

|            | The unit emphasizes that    |     chatter; shifting →   |
|            | attention works differently |     changing from reading |
|            | across people and           |     to listening).        |

|            | as both a trainable skill   |     goal-setting,         |
|            | and a variable experience,  |     minimizing            |

| Mind's     | This lesson introduces      |                           |
| Spotlight  | attention as the mind's     | 1.  **Define** attention  |
|            | spotlight---the ability to  |     as the mind\'s        |
|            | shine focus on one thing    |     spotlight that        |
|            | while ignoring others. Just |     selects what to       |
|            | as a spotlight on a stage   |     notice from all       |
|            | helps the audience see the  |     available             |
|            | most important part of the  |     information.          |
|            | play, attention helps the   |                           |
|            | mind pick out what matters  | 2.  **Explain** how       |
|            | from all the sights,        |     attention determines  |
|            | sounds, and feelings around |     what gets learned and |
|            | us.                         |     remembered (e.g.,     |
|            |                             |     \"When I focus on the |
|            | Children learn that without |     teacher\'s words, I   |
|            | attention, the mind's       |     remember them         |
|            | "storage box" (memory) and  |     better\").            |

|            | cannot work as well,        | 3.  **Distinguish**       |
|            | because attention is what   |     between strong        |
|            | decides what gets noticed   |     attention (spotlight  |
|            | and remembered. They        |     focused) and          |
|            | explore everyday examples,  |     wandering attention   |
|            | such as how focusing on a   |     (spotlight drifting)  |
|            | teacher's words makes it    |     through               |
|            | easier to learn, while      |     self-observation.     |
|            | being distracted makes      |                           |
|            | remembering harder.         | 4.  **Describe** what it  |
|            |                             |     feels like when their |
|            | Through guided activities,  |     attention is focused  |
|            | children practice noticing  |     versus when it        |
|            | what it feels like when     |     wanders during an     |
|            | their attention is strong   |     activity.             |
|            | versus when it wanders. The |                           |
|            | lesson emphasizes curiosity | 5.  **Recognize** that    |
|            | and empowerment: attention  |     attention is a skill  |
|            | is not just something that  |     that can be           |
|            | drifts---it is a skill that |     understood, trained,  |
|            | can be understood, trained, |     and used to support   |
|            | and used to help learning,  |     learning and          |

| Kinds of   | This lesson introduces      |                           |
| Attention  | children to the idea that   | 1.  **Identify** the      |
|            | attention is not just one   |     three types of        |
|            | thing---there are different |     attention---sustained |
|            | kinds of attention that the |     (staying focused),    |
|            | mind uses for different     |     selective (blocking   |
|            | purposes. Sometimes we need |     distractions), and    |
|            | **sustained attention** to  |     shifting (changing    |
|            | keep our focus on one       |     focus)---and give one |
|            | activity for a while, like  |     example of each.      |
|            | finishing a drawing. Other  |                           |
|            | times we need **selective   | 2.  **Match** attention   |
|            | attention** to block out    |     types to appropriate  |
|            | distractions, like          |     situations (e.g.,     |
|            | listening to a story even   |     sustained → finishing |
|            | when classmates are talking |     a puzzle; selective → |
|            | nearby. And at times we     |     listening to a story  |
|            | need **shifting             |     despite noise;        |
|            | attention**, moving our     |     shifting → stopping   |
|            | focus quickly when          |     play to hear an       |
|            | something new or important  |     instruction).         |
|            | happens, like stopping a    |                           |
|            | game to hear an             | 3.  **Recognize** which   |

|            | these kinds of attention    |     understanding by      |
|            | gives children more control |     identifying which     |

|            | This helps children build   |                           |
|            | curiosity about their inner |                           |

|            | can be understood,          |                           |
|            | observed, and used to make  |                           |

|            | idea that problems are a      | 1.  **Define** problems |
|            | normal part of everyday life. |     as normal           |
|            | Children learn that problems  |     challenges that     |
|            | are not "bad" or something to |     give minds          |
|            | be ashamed of---they are      |     opportunities to    |
|            | simply challenges that the    |     work, not signs of  |
|            | mind and body can work to     |     failure or shame.   |
|            | solve. Just as puzzles in     |                         |
|            | games are meant to be figured | 2.  **Categorize**      |
|            | out, real-life problems give  |     problems by size:   |
|            | us opportunities to think,    |     small (everyday     |
|            | choose, and grow.             |     hassles), medium    |
|            |                               |     (disagreements),    |

|            | The lesson emphasizes         |     (thinking, feeling, |
|            | resilience: problems are not  |     doing).             |
|            | signs of weakness but chances |                         |

|            | structured framework for      |     four steps of       |
|            | solving problems. Instead of  |     problem-solving:    |
|            | reacting automatically or     |     Stop and Notice →   |
|            | feeling stuck, the mind can   |     Think of Options →  |

|            | What matters is persistence:  |     trying again with   |
