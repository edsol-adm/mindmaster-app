        "Psychology is the science of the mind and behavior. That means psychologists try to understand what people think, how they feel, and why they act the way they do. Sometimes psychology looks at things we can see on the outside, like actions. Other times it studies things on the inside, like thoughts and emotions that we cannot see directly.",
        "One way psychologists do this is through experiments. An experiment is a way to test an idea about how people behave. A famous example is the Marshmallow Test. In this experiment, young children were given one marshmallow. They were told that if they waited and did not eat it, they would get a second marshmallow later. Some children ate the marshmallow right away, while others waited for the bigger reward.",
        "The Marshmallow Test showed how people’s thoughts and decisions (like wanting more later) affect their actions (waiting or eating). It also taught us that self-control—being able to wait for a reward—is an important part of psychology."
