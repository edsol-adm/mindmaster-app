# MindMaster ‚Äì Alpha Curriculum Prototype

This folder contains the **Alpha Curriculum Prototype** for MindMaster.  
The focus of this prototype is to validate the **psychology literacy curriculum and pedagogy** with children and teachers.  
It is not the final technical design ‚Äì advanced features will be built post-award in the Beta stage under a Rapid Application Development (RAD) approach.

## Curriculum logic
Each activity is intentionally designed to reflect a Grade 1 psychology topic. Together, they form the foundation of **psychology literacy** for children (ages 6‚Äì7).

1. **What is psychology?** ‚Üí *Carpool Game*  
   Children see how choices and situations influence outcomes, introducing metacognition (‚Äúthinking about thinking‚Äù).  

2. **What are emotions?** ‚Üí *Emotions Game*  
   Builds emotional vocabulary and recognition skills, helping children label and respond to basic feelings.  

3. **Memory games and activities** ‚Üí *Memory Game* & *Memory 2 Game*  
   Strengthens recall, noticing gaps, and short-term memory retrieval.  

4. **Simple sensory exploration** ‚Üí *Senses Game*  
   Links sight and sound perception to learning, showing how the senses feed into memory and attention.  

5. **Basics of attention and focus** ‚Üí *Attention Game* & *Attention 2 Game*  
   Practice filtering distractions and sustaining focus on relevant stimuli.  

6. **Imagination and storytelling** ‚Üí *Storytime Game*  
   Develops sequencing, cause‚Äìeffect understanding, and narrative imagination.  

7. **Family and friendship dynamics** ‚Üí *Carpool* and *Teamwork*  
   Introduces group interaction, shared responsibility, and navigating positive/negative group outcomes.  

8. **How do we think?** ‚Üí *Solve Game*  
   Encourages step-by-step logical reasoning and reflection on problem-solving processes.  

9. **Understanding and sharing feelings** ‚Üí *Emotions* (primary) and *Storytime* (secondary)  
   Helps children identify feelings in themselves and others, building empathy and perspective-taking.  

10. **Teamwork and cooperation** ‚Üí *Teamwork Game*  
   Reinforces collaboration, patience, and mutual support to achieve shared goals.

## Next steps
- **Beta Prototype**: build in advanced app features (teacher dashboards, analytics, offline-first design).  
- **Iterative RAD testing**: multiple cycles of user testing and refinement.  
- **Link to evaluation**: User feedback for this Alpha Curriculum Prototype is available in  
  [`/unicef-venture-fund-2025-submission/user-testing-alpha/`](../unicef-venture-fund-2025-submission/user-testing-alpha/).
