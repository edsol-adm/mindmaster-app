# MindMaster – Alpha Curriculum Prototype

MindMaster is a psychology literacy app that builds children’s resilience by turning knowledge into self-efficacy and everyday problem-solving skills.  
This Alpha prototype validates the **psychology literacy curriculum and pedagogy** with children and teachers.  
It is not the final technical design. Advanced features will be built in the Beta stage under a Rapid Application Development (RAD) approach.

## Curriculum and Gamified Practice (Alpha Prototype)

Each Grade 1 unit introduces a **core psychology literacy concept**, structured to follow how children naturally develop psychological understanding—from recognising their inner world, to managing focus, memory, emotions, relationships, and social problem-solving.

| # | Unit Title | Core Concept |
|---|------------|--------------|
| 1 | **What is Psychology?** | Minds have three connected parts — Thinking, Feeling, and Doing — that shape how we experience and act in the world. |
| 2 | **Exploring Our Senses** | The senses are the “doorways” of the mind, gathering different types of information that shape perception and understanding. |
| 3 | **Basic Attention and Focus** | Attention works like a spotlight — selecting what to notice, learn, and remember. It can be trained and supported. |
| 4 | **How Memory Works** | Memory is a flexible tool for collecting, keeping, and bringing back information to make sense of past and present. |
| 5 | **Imagination and Storytelling** | Imagination is the mind’s playground; storytelling gives it structure, allowing us to explore, plan, and share ideas. |
| 6 | **What Are Feelings?** | Feelings are information messengers that help us understand ourselves and our world. |
| 7 | **Family and Friendship Dynamics** | Relationships are systems we can understand, nurture, and navigate through kindness, trust, and cooperation. |
| 8 | **Problem-Solving Basics** | Problem-solving integrates thinking and feeling to find constructive pathways through everyday dilemmas. |
| 9 | **Our Actions and Impact** | Our choices have effects on others and the environment — awareness builds responsibility. |
| 10 | **Teamwork and Cooperation** | Working together requires turn-taking, fairness, shared goals, and respect. |

## Roadmap logic

The **student-home.html** screen ties everything into a coherent flow:

- **Explore** – Lesson summaries that introduce key concepts (future chatbot).  
- **Practice** – Gamified Practice activities (this Alpha).  
- **Reflection** – Prompts that help children connect learning to their own experiences (future chatbot).

This roadmap models **knowledge → application → reflection**, ensuring children not only learn concepts but also apply them to build resilience.

---

## Assets
All images and audio are stored in the `assets/` subfolders:
- `assets/attention/` → sprites for the Attention games
- `assets/emotions/` → positive/negative emotions
- `assets/thoughts/` → positive/negative thoughts
- `assets/audio/` → background music & sound effects

---

## Next steps
- **Beta Prototype**: advanced app features (teacher dashboards, analytics, offline-first design, chatbot Explore & Reflection).  
- **Iterative RAD testing**: multiple cycles of user testing and refinement.  
- **User testing**: This Alpha has already been piloted with children and teachers. A feedback summary will be uploaded here.
