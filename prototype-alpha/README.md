# MindMaster – Alpha Curriculum Prototype

This folder contains the **Alpha Curriculum Prototype** for MindMaster.  
The focus of this prototype is to validate the **psychology literacy curriculum and pedagogy** with children and teachers.  
It is not the final technical design – advanced features will be built post-award in the Beta stage under a Rapid Application Development (RAD) approach.

## Activities included
- **Attention** → Practice focusing on positive stimuli and ignoring distractions.  
- **Attention 2** → Strengthen selective attention by handling distractors.  
- **Carpool (Intro to Psychology)** → Explore scenarios with positive and negative choices.  
- **Emotions** → Recognize, label, and respond to emotions constructively.

- **Storytime** → Recall and sequence events from short stories.  
- **Teamwork** → Cooperate to complete a shared challenge.  

---

## Curriculum logic
Each activity is intentionally designed to reflect a Grade 1 psychology topic. Together, they form the foundation of **psychology literacy** for children (ages 6–7).

1. **What is psychology?** → *Carpool Game*  
   Children see how choices and situations influence outcomes, introducing metacognition (“thinking about thinking”).  

2. **What are emotions?** → *Emotions Game*  
   Builds emotional vocabulary and recognition skills, helping children label and respond to basic feelings.  

3. **Memory games and activities** → *Memory Game* & *Memory 2 Game*  
   Strengthens recall, noticing gaps, and short-term memory retrieval.  

4. **Simple sensory exploration** → *Senses Game*  
   Links sight and sound perception to learning, showing how the senses feed into memory and attention.  

5. **Basics of attention and focus** → *Attention Game* & *Attention 2 Game*  
   Practice filtering distractions and sustaining focus on relevant stimuli.  

6. **Imagination and storytelling** → *Storytime Game*  
   Develops sequencing, cause–effect understanding, and narrative imagination.  

7. **Family and friendship dynamics** → *Carpool* and *Teamwork*  
   Introduces group interaction, shared responsibility, and navigating positive/negative group outcomes.  

8. **How do we think?** → *Solve Game*  
   Encourages step-by-step logical reasoning and reflection on problem-solving processes.  

9. **Understanding and sharing feelings** → *Emotions* (primary) and *Storytime* (secondary)  
   Helps children identify feelings in themselves and others, building empathy and perspective-taking.  

10. **Teamwork and cooperation** → *Teamwork Game*  
    Reinforces collaboration, patience, and mutual support to achieve shared goals.

### Student Home (Roadmap logic)
The **student-home.html** screen ties these activities into a coherent curriculum flow.  
- **Explore** – Lesson summaries that introduce key concepts. In future builds, these will be guided by a friendly chatbot learning buddy, making summaries child-friendly and accessible.  
- **Practice** – Interactive activities (In-Class Activities and Home Games). These are the gamified prototypes provided in this Alpha.  
- **Reflection** – Prompts that help children think about their experiences and learning. In the real build, these will also be scaffolded by the chatbot to reduce intimidation and encourage sharing.  

This roadmap models the intended **knowledge → application → reflection** cycle, ensuring activities are not isolated games but part of a structured psychology literacy curriculum.

## Assets
All images and audio are stored in the `assets/` subfolders:  
- `assets/attention/` → sprites for the Attention game  
- `assets/emotions/` → positive/negative emotions  
- `assets/thoughts/` → positive/negative thoughts  
- `assets/audio/` → background music & sound effects  

---

## Next steps
- **Beta Prototype**: build in advanced app features (teacher dashboards, analytics, offline-first design, chatbot Explore & Reflection).  
- **Iterative RAD testing**: multiple cycles of user testing and refinement.  
- **User testing**: This Alpha prototype has already been tested with children and teachers (10 students, 2 teachers). A concise feedback summary will be uploaded here to document insights.
