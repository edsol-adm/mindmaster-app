# MindMaster â€“ Alpha Curriculum Prototype

MindMaster is a psychology literacy app that builds childrenâ€™s resilience by turning knowledge into self-efficacy and everyday problem-solving skills.  
This Alpha prototype validates the **psychology literacy curriculum and pedagogy** with children and teachers.  
It is not the final technical design. Advanced features will be built in the Beta stage under a Rapid Application Development (RAD) approach.
