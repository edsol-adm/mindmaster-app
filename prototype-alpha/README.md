# MindMaster â€“ Alpha Curriculum Prototype

MindMaster is a psychology literacy app that builds childrenâ€™s resilience by turning knowledge into self-efficacy and everyday problem-solving skills.  
This Alpha prototype validates the **psychology literacy curriculum and pedagogy** with children and teachers.  
It is not the final technical design. Advanced features will be built in the Beta stage under a Rapid Application Development (RAD) approach.

2. **What Are Feelings?** â€“ Naming emotions and body cues  
   â€¢ Emotions  

3. **Memory Through Play** â€“ Using memory to learn and share experiences  
   â€¢ Memory, Memory 2  

4. **Simple Sensory Exploration** â€“ Connecting senses to feelings and thoughts  
   â€¢ Senses  

5. **Basic Attention and Focus** â€“ Practice focusing and ignoring distractions

## Roadmap logic
The **student-home.html** screen ties everything into a coherent flow:  

- **Explore** â€“ Lesson summaries that introduce key concepts (future chatbot).  
- **Practice** â€“ Gamified Practice activities (this Alpha).  
- **Reflection** â€“ Prompts that help children connect learning to their own experiences (future chatbot).  

This roadmap models **knowledge â†’ application â†’ reflection**, ensuring children not only learn concepts but also apply them to build resilience.  

---

## Assets
All images and audio are stored in the `assets/` subfolders:  
- `assets/attention/` â†’ sprites for the Attention games  
- `assets/emotions/` â†’ positive/negative emotions  
- `assets/thoughts/` â†’ positive/negative thoughts  
- `assets/audio/` â†’ background music & sound effects  

---

## Next steps
- **Beta Prototype**: advanced app features (teacher dashboards, analytics, offline-first design, chatbot Explore & Reflection).  
- **Iterative RAD testing**: multiple cycles of user testing and refinement.  
- **User testing**: This Alpha has already been piloted with children and teachers. A feedback summary will be uploaded here.
