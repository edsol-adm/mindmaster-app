# MindMaster â€“ Alpha Curriculum Prototype

This folder contains the **Alpha Curriculum Prototype** for MindMaster.  
The focus of this prototype is to validate the **psychology literacy curriculum and pedagogy** with children and teachers.  
It is not the final technical design â€“ advanced features will be built post-award in the Beta stage under a Rapid Application Development (RAD) approach.
