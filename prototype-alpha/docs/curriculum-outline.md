# MindMaster – Grade 1 Curriculum Outline  
*(Alpha Prototype)*

This document provides the **Grade 1 curriculum outline** for MindMaster, designed for children ages 6–7.  
The goal is to lay the foundation of **psychology literacy**, helping children build knowledge that leads to **self-empowerment**, grows into **self-efficacy** (“I can do this”), and develops into **mental resilience** (“I can handle tricky situations better”).  

The curriculum is taught through interactive lessons and reinforced by **Gamified Practice** activities in the Alpha prototype.

## Unit Overview

### Unit 1 – Psychology of the Mind: Ourselves and Others  
Children are introduced to psychology as the study of **thinking, feeling, and doing**. They begin to notice that both they and others have inner experiences and outward actions, the first step to understanding themselves and relationships.  

### Unit 2 – What Are Feelings?  
Learners practice naming basic emotions such as happy, sad, angry, or worried. They also notice body signals that go along with feelings, like a fast heartbeat or a tight tummy. Recognizing feelings helps them manage their own reactions and understand others better.  

### Unit 3 – Imagination and Storytelling  
Through play and stories, children see how imagination creates ideas and feelings inside the mind. They learn that storytelling helps share these inner worlds with others, strengthening empathy and creativity.  

### Unit 4 – Family and Friendship Dynamics  
Children explore bonds of trust, belonging, and care in families and friendships. They begin to see how relationships affect their feelings of safety and confidence, and how their own actions matter to others.  

### Unit 5 – Teamwork and Cooperation  
Group games and activities show that working together requires sharing, listening, and taking turns. Children practice noticing how cooperation makes tasks easier and more enjoyable, while also building respect and empathy.  

### Unit 6 – Simple Sensory Exploration  
Learners explore sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell to see how the senses connect with both **feelings and thoughts**. A loud sound might cause fear, while a familiar smell might bring back a memory. Children discover that the outside world shapes what they feel and think on the inside.  

### Unit 7 – Basic Attention and Focus  
Children practice short, playful activities that involve focusing on one thing at a time, like noticing sounds or playing quick memory games. They begin to understand that attention helps them stay calm, finish tasks, and learn new things.  

### Unit 8 – Memory Through Play  
Songs, rhymes, and matching games help children see how memory stores experiences, thoughts, and feelings. Remembering allows them to learn from the past, plan for what is next, and share stories with others. Memory becomes a bridge between their inner world and the outside world.  

### Unit 9 – Problem-Solving Basics  
Children explore everyday dilemmas that feel real in their school lives, such as sharing limited resources, admitting mistakes, welcoming new peers, handling unfairness, standing up to unkindness, or deciding what to do when they find something that is not theirs. They practice looking at problems through feelings, thoughts, and actions to see how choices lead to different outcomes.  

### Unit 10 – Our Actions and Impact  
Learners reflect on how every action has consequences, whether helpful or hurtful. They explore how thinking and feeling guide choices, and how those choices affect themselves and others. This integration of the triad helps them see that they can influence outcomes in positive ways.
