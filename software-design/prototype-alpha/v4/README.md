# Prototype Alpha v4 — System Integration Validation (PWA + AI)

## Purpose of Alpha v4

Prototype Alpha v4 extends the Alpha phase to validate **system-level feasibility**, following the successful completion of Alpha v3, which confirmed the viability of the core learning engine.

The purpose of Alpha v4 is to test whether:
- The PowerMind learning experience remains usable and coherent when delivered as a **Progressive Web App (PWA)**, and
- A **tightly governed AI component** can be integrated without disrupting pedagogy, learner autonomy, or instructional clarity.

Alpha v4 does **not** aim to validate learning outcomes, platform stability, or production readiness. It remains firmly within the Alpha scope.

## What Alpha v4 Builds On

Alpha v4 builds directly on the outcomes of **Prototype Alpha v3**, which validated:
- Classroom usability of the activity-level learning design
- Instructional clarity for early primary learners
- Learner independence and engagement
- Teacher-perceived pedagogical fit, including suitability for Grade 1 learners

Alpha v3 formally closed the learning-engine validation phase.  
Alpha v4 introduces **new system-level risks** for validation.

## Scope of Alpha v4

Alpha v4 focuses on **integration and behaviour**, not polish or scale.

### 1. PWA Delivery Validation

Alpha v4 introduces PWA delivery to assess:
- Whether navigation and learning flow remain clear when accessed as a web-installed app
- How installability, session handling, and offline assumptions affect usability
- Whether technical delivery constraints interfere with instructional intent

The PWA implementation is **functional but incomplete**, and is treated as an Alpha artefact.

---

### 2. AI Functionality Validation

Alpha v4 introduces a **limited, non-conversational AI component** designed to support learning without acting as a chatbot, therapist, or autonomous agent.

The AI functionality is intentionally constrained to:
- Specific, predefined pedagogical roles
- Context-bound prompts and support
- Clear behavioural boundaries and safeguards

Alpha v4 testing focuses on:
- Whether the AI remains within its defined role
- Whether learners correctly understand what the AI is for
- Whether AI presence supports clarity rather than distraction
- Whether AI behaviour aligns with psychology literacy principles rather than SEL or counselling models

AI performance optimisation, generative breadth, and adaptive intelligence are **explicitly out of scope** at this stage.

### 3. Unit-Level Flow Under System Conditions

Alpha v4 tests:
- End-to-end flow of Unit 1 content within a live system
- Transitions between activities under real platform conditions
- Cognitive load when multiple system elements (navigation, AI prompts, delivery constraints) are present

This testing assesses **system coherence**, not curriculum completeness.

---

## What Alpha v4 Does *Not* Test

Alpha v4 does **not** test:
- Learning outcomes or impact
- Behavioural or wellbeing change
- Platform stability at scale
- Performance benchmarks
- Teacher dashboards or analytics
- Classroom sync or multi-user management
- Home learning workflows
- AI effectiveness or adaptivity

These elements are intentionally deferred.

---

## Testing Focus in Alpha v4

Alpha v4 testing is exploratory and observational, focusing on:
- System usability under real delivery conditions
- AI role clarity and non-intrusiveness
- Interaction between learning design and technical constraints
- Identification of friction points that must be resolved before Pre-Beta

Testing outcomes are documented through:
- System-level observation
- Iteration notes capturing design decisions
- Controlled feedback synthesis

No raw user data is collected or retained.

---

## Status and Limitations

Prototype Alpha v4 is **in progress**.

Known limitations at this stage include:
- Incomplete PWA features
- Early-stage technical roughness
- Limited AI functionality by design
- Ongoing refinement of navigation and interaction smoothness

These limitations are acceptable and expected within Alpha.

---

## Relationship to Pre-Beta

Alpha v4 does **not** represent Pre-Beta.

Progression to Pre-Beta will occur only when:
- Core activities are technically stable and no longer clunky
- Navigation and transitions are predictable and smooth
- AI behaviour is consistent, bounded, and non-distracting
- Unit 1 can be completed end-to-end without workaround or explanation

Until these conditions are met, development remains within Alpha by design.

---

## Summary

Prototype Alpha v4 validates whether the PowerMind learning experience can function as a **coherent system** when delivered through a PWA and supported by a governed AI component.

It represents a deliberate, disciplined extension of the Alpha phase to reduce system-level risk before claiming readiness for broader testing or pilot deployment.
