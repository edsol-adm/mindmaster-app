# 🧪 PowerMind (MindMaster) – Prototype Alpha

This directory contains **Alpha-stage software design prototypes** for the PowerMind (formerly MindMaster) application.

Each Alpha version is a **time-bound, self-contained artefact** created to validate a specific dimension of the product, such as curriculum, pedagogy, interaction logic, or platform translation.  
Older versions are retained intentionally for transparency, auditability, and design traceability.

## ⭐ Current Iteration

### ▶️ Alpha v5 (Current)

**Focus:**  
Integrated prototype consolidating validated curriculum, pedagogy, and system design decisions from earlier Alpha iterations.

**Status:**  
Active reference for reviewers, partners, and funders.

📂 Start here:  
`/software-design/prototype-alpha/v5/README.md`

If you are reviewing PowerMind for the first time, **v5 is the correct entry point**.

## 📁 Alpha Version Overview

| Version | Status | Primary Validation Focus |
|-------|--------|--------------------------|
| **v5** | 🟢 Current | Integrated Alpha reference combining curriculum, pedagogy, and platform logic |
| v4 | 🟡 Superseded | Early live-platform translation of validated curriculum |
| v3 | 🔵 Archived | Curriculum and pedagogy validation via standalone HTML prototype |
| v2 | ⚪ Archived | Early interaction and learning-flow exploration |
| v1 | ⚪ Archived | Initial concept and structural exploration |

Each version folder contains its **own README.md** explaining scope, intent, and limitations for that iteration.

## 🧭 How to Use This Folder

- Reviewers and funders  
  → Start with **Alpha v5**

- Curriculum and pedagogy analysis  
  → Refer to **Alpha v3** as the canonical validation artefact

- Platform evolution and translation context  
  → Compare **v3 → v4 → v5**

This structure reflects **intentional iteration**, not parallel development.

## 🧠 What “Alpha” Means in PowerMind

In the PowerMind development model, **Alpha prototypes** are used to:

- validate learning science and pedagogy before scaling  
- test interaction logic without production constraints  
- de-risk conceptual and educational assumptions early  

Alpha prototypes are **not feature-complete**, **not performance-optimised**, and **not representative of final UI polish**.

Technical hardening, scalability, analytics, and production architecture are addressed in later stages.

## 📌 Governance and Traceability

- No Alpha version is overwritten  
- Major conceptual shifts are captured as new versions  
- Deprecated versions remain accessible for audit and comparison  

This approach supports:
- funder due diligence  
- research transparency  
- long-term product governance

## 🚀 Next Phases (Beyond Alpha)

- Beta prototype with production-grade architecture  
- Teacher dashboards and learning analytics  
- Offline-first and low-bandwidth optimisation  
- AI-supported Explore and Reflection flows  
- Scaled pilots with partner organisations
