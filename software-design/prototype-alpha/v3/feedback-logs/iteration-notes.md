# Prototype Alpha v3 — Iteration Notes

This document records the **key design decisions and refinements made for Prototype Alpha v3**, based on findings from earlier Alpha iterations and aligned with the testing focus described in Technical Template 2.

Iteration notes document **what was changed, why it was changed, and what was intentionally deferred**, as part of a Rapid Application Development (RAD) approach.

## 1. Navigation Clarity and Entry Flow

**Observation (from Alpha v2):**  
Students experienced hesitation when entering activities, particularly at initial menu and task entry screens. Navigation cues were not always immediately clear.

**Decision:**  
Improve visual hierarchy and simplify entry flow into activities.

**Actions Taken in v3:**  
- Reduced visual clutter on entry screens  
- Clarified start cues and task entry affordances  
- Streamlined transitions between menu and activity screens  

**Outcome Observed in v3:**  
- Navigation-related confusion was significantly reduced  
- Students were generally able to enter activities independently after initial exposure  

**Status:** Implemented in v3

## 2. Instruction Placement and Wording

**Observation (from Alpha v2):**  
While instructions were present, some students required clarification before beginning tasks, indicating room for improvement in instruction clarity and placement.

**Decision:**  
Refine instruction wording and ensure instructions are immediately visible and actionable.

**Actions Taken in v3:**  
- Simplified instructional language  
- Improved placement of instructions within the screen layout  
- Ensured consistency of instruction format across activities  

**Outcome Observed in v3:**  
- High rate of independent task completion  
- Student questionnaire responses and observation indicated instructions were easy to understand  

**Status:** Implemented in v3

## 3. Interaction Pattern Consistency

**Observation (from Alpha v2):**  
Inconsistent interaction mechanics across activities increased cognitive load for some students.

**Decision:**  
Standardise core interaction patterns across activities.

**Actions Taken in v3:**  
- Reused a small set of consistent interaction types (tap, select, sort, drag-and-drop)  
- Avoided introducing new interaction mechanics mid-session  

**Outcome Observed in v3:**  
- Students quickly learned interaction patterns and reused them confidently  
- Reduced need for adult intervention during task execution  

**Status:** Implemented in v3

## 4. Feedback and Self-Correction Design

**Observation (from Alpha v2):**  
Feedback cues were functional but limited in supporting self-correction.

**Decision:**  
Strengthen feedback mechanisms to encourage retry and persistence without explicit instruction.

**Actions Taken in v3:**  
- Improved visual feedback following incorrect responses  
- Enabled immediate retry opportunities  
- Avoided providing direct answers or hints  

**Outcome Observed in v3:**  
- Students often retried tasks independently after errors  
- Trial-and-error behaviour supported learning engagement  

**Status:** Implemented in v3

## 5. Engagement Support Without Over-Polish

**Observation (from Alpha v2 and early v3 testing):**  
Engagement was present, but the prototype remained technically simple and visually unpolished.

**Decision:**  
Prioritise instructional clarity and usability over technical polish at Alpha stage.

**Actions Taken in v3:**  
- Focused development effort on clarity, flow, and comprehension  
- Deferred advanced animations, performance optimisation, and visual polish  

**Outcome Observed in v3:**  
- Students remained engaged and willing to continue activities  
- Prototype successfully supported sustained attention despite early-stage technical limitations  

**Status:** Implemented as a conscious scope decision

## 6. Grade-Level Appropriateness Assessment

**Observation (from Alpha v3 testing):**  
Testing involved Grade 3 students, while the target group begins at Grade 1.

**Decision:**  
Rely on teacher professional judgement to assess developmental appropriateness for Grade 1 learners.

**Actions Taken in v3:**  
- Collected explicit teacher feedback on content difficulty, language level, and pacing  
- Analysed whether observed Grade 3 performance indicated excessive or appropriate cognitive demand  

**Outcome Observed in v3:**  
- Teachers judged content and pedagogy to be appropriate for Grade 1  
- Minor pacing adjustments identified as sufficient for younger learners  

**Status:** Validated pedagogically; Grade 1 piloting deferred to later phase

## 7. Features Intentionally Deferred Beyond Alpha

Based on Alpha v3 findings and Technical Template 2 scope, the following were **explicitly deferred**:

- Learning analytics and dashboards  
- Classroom sync and multi-user management  
- Home learning workflows  
- AI-supported features  
- PWA packaging and installability  
- Performance optimisation and technical polish  

**Rationale:**  
These elements introduce system-level complexity and were outside the risk scope of Alpha testing, which focused on validating the learning engine, usability, and classroom fit.

**Status:** Deferred to subsequent development phases

## 8. Summary of Iteration Outcomes

Prototype Alpha v3 reflects a **consolidation of learning from v1 and v2**, with targeted refinements focused on:

- Navigation clarity  
- Instructional comprehensibility  
- Interaction consistency  
- Learner autonomy  
- Classroom viability  

These iteration outcomes support the decision to **formally close the Alpha phase** and progress to subsequent development focused on system integration and technical refinement.
