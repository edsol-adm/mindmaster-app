# Prototype Alpha v3 — Student Observations

This document summarises **observed student behaviour patterns** during Prototype Alpha v3 testing.  
Observations were gathered through direct supervision during classroom-style sessions and are synthesised to highlight **design-relevant insights**, not individual performance.

No personally identifiable information or raw response data is included.

---

## 1. Entry and Orientation Behaviour

- Most students were able to begin activities without adult prompting after initial orientation.
- Brief hesitation was observed at the first task entry screen, particularly around understanding where to tap to start.
- Once the first activity was completed, subsequent task entry required little to no clarification.

**Implication:**  
Initial onboarding cues are important, but repeated interaction quickly builds user confidence.

---

## 2. Instruction Comprehension

- Students generally read or listened to on-screen instructions before attempting tasks.
- Instructions were understood on first exposure in most cases.
- When mistakes occurred, students were more likely to retry independently than seek adult help.

**Implication:**  
Instruction design effectively supports independent task execution and self-correction.

---

## 3. Interaction Patterns

- Core interaction types (tapping, selecting, sorting, drag-and-drop) were quickly learned.
- Students applied learned interaction patterns consistently across different activities.
- Motor interaction demands were appropriate for early primary learners, with minimal frustration observed.

**Implication:**  
Interaction mechanics are developmentally appropriate and reusable across activity formats.

---

## 4. Navigation and Flow

- Navigation-related confusion observed in earlier Alpha iterations was significantly reduced.
- Students were generally able to move between screens without losing task context.
- Occasional pauses occurred at transition points, suggesting opportunities for clearer visual feedback or transition cues.

**Implication:**  
Overall navigation flow is functional, with minor refinements needed for smoother transitions.

---

## 5. Feedback and Self-Correction

- Students paid attention to visual feedback following actions.
- Incorrect responses often led to immediate retries rather than disengagement.
- Feedback cues supported learning through trial-and-error rather than explicit instruction.

**Implication:**  
Feedback design encourages persistence and independent problem-solving.

---

## 6. Engagement and Persistence

- Students generally remained focused during activities without frequent redirection.
- Several students voluntarily replayed activities after completion.
- Attention was sustained even when tasks were challenging, provided instructions were clear.

**Implication:**  
The prototype supports baseline engagement and willingness to persist, even without high technical polish.

---

## 7. Language and Visual Accessibility

- Language used within the activities was accessible to early primary learners.
- Visual elements supported comprehension and reduced reliance on text alone.
- Students were able to infer task goals using visual cues when unsure.

**Implication:**  
The combination of language and visuals supports accessibility across varying literacy levels.

---

## 8. Observed Limitations

- Minor technical delays or less responsive interactions occasionally disrupted flow.
- Some transitions lacked clear confirmation signals, leading to brief hesitation.
- These issues did not prevent task completion but affected smoothness of experience.

**Implication:**  
Technical refinement and performance optimisation are priorities for subsequent development phases.

## 9. Summary of Student-Level Insights

Across Alpha v3 testing, students demonstrated:
- High levels of instructional comprehension
- Ability to work independently
- Willingness to persist and retry
- Growing confidence as activities progressed

These observations support the conclusion that the Alpha prototype is **usable, understandable, and classroom-viable** at the activity level, while also highlighting areas for technical refinement in future phases.
