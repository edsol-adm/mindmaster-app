# 🧠 MindMaster – Alpha v3 Prototype  
**Curriculum & Pedagogy Validation (Software Design)**

**Status:** Archived Alpha iteration  
**Version:** Alpha v3  
**Purpose:** Curriculum and pedagogy validation with children and teachers

---

## What Alpha v3 Is

Alpha v3 is a standalone HTML-based prototype developed to validate the psychology literacy curriculum, learning flow, and gamified pedagogy of MindMaster (now PowerMind) for Grade 1 learners.

This iteration focuses on one core question:

> Do children meaningfully understand and apply psychology literacy concepts when taught through structured lessons and gamified practice?

Alpha v3 intentionally prioritises curriculum design and pedagogy over production-grade technical architecture.

---

## What Alpha v3 Is Not

- ❌ Not a live production platform  
- ❌ Not a complete app experience  
- ❌ Not a technical architecture reference  
- ❌ Not representative of final UI or UX polish  

Advanced features such as analytics, dashboards, offline-first support, and AI-supported Explore and Reflection flows are out of scope for this iteration.

---

## Relationship to Later Versions (Context Only)

Alpha v3 informed all subsequent PowerMind development.

Later iterations (Alpha v4 onwards) translate validated Alpha v3 curriculum and pedagogy into live environments. They do not introduce new curriculum concepts.

Alpha v3 should be treated as the pedagogical reference point for the PowerMind system.

## How to Explore Alpha v3

### ▶️ Recommended entry point

Start with the **Student Home** screen, which presents the intended learning roadmap:

https://edsol-adm.github.io/mindmaster-app/software-design/prototype-alpha/v3/student-home.html

From here, learners can:
- 📘 view the full Grade 1 curriculum structure  
- 🧭 navigate units and lessons  
- 🎮 access all available gamified Practice activities  

> ℹ️ Note  
> Each unit displays four lessons, but only **Lesson 1 includes gamified practice** in Alpha v3.  
> This was sufficient to validate pedagogy and concept comprehension.

## 📚 Curriculum Scope Validated in Alpha v3

Alpha v3 validates the full Grade 1 psychology literacy curriculum across ten units.

| Unit | Core Concept |
|-----|--------------|
| 1 | Thinking, Feeling, and Doing form an interconnected system |
| 2 | Senses are the mind’s information gateways |
| 3 | Attention selects what we notice and learn |
| 4 | Memory is flexible and trainable |
| 5 | Imagination enables planning and meaning-making |
| 6 | Feelings are information messengers |
| 7 | Relationships are systems that can be understood |
| 8 | Problems can be approached systematically |
| 9 | Actions create effects |
| 10 | Cooperation requires shared goals and roles |

## 🧭 Learning Roadmap Logic (Alpha v3)

The Alpha v3 prototype models a three-part learning sequence:

1. **Explore** – concept introduction  
2. **Practice** – gamified activities  
3. **Reflect** – conceptual reflection prompts  

This structure operationalises the theory of change:

**Knowledge → Application → Self-efficacy**

## 🗂️ Assets

All assets used in Alpha v3 are stored locally:

- `assets/attention/`  
- `assets/emotions/`  
- `assets/thoughts/`  
- `assets/audio/`  

---

## 🚀 Post–Alpha v3 Direction

- Translation of validated curriculum into live platforms (Alpha v4+)  
- AI-supported Explore and Reflection flows  
- Teacher dashboards and learning analytics  
- Continued iterative testing under a Rapid Application Development approach  

Alpha v3 remains the canonical reference for curriculum and pedagogy validation.
