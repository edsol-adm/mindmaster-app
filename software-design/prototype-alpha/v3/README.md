# Prototype Alpha v3 — Classroom Usability & Engagement Validation

## Purpose of v3

Prototype Alpha v3 represents the **final iteration of the Alpha phase**.  
This iteration consolidated learnings from v1 and v2 into a refined, fully playable prototype and focused on validating **classroom usability, instructional clarity, and learner engagement**.

At this stage, the key question was:

> Does the Alpha prototype work as a coherent learning experience that children can navigate independently and teachers can realistically use in classrooms?

---

## What v3 Consisted Of

Prototype Alpha v3 tested the **complete Alpha artefact**, which is located in the parent `prototype-alpha/` directory.

The artefact included:
- Multiple fully playable interactive activities
- Refined navigation and visual hierarchy
- Clear on-screen instructions
- Polished interaction patterns and transitions
- Offline-first delivery
- Supporting media assets and demonstration videos

This folder (`v3/`) contains **testing documentation only**.  
No executable code or assets are stored here.

## What Was Tested in v3

Testing in v3 focused on **real-use viability**, not feature expansion.

### 1. Instructional clarity
- Could students understand what to do without adult explanation?
- Were task instructions clear and actionable on-screen?

### 2. Learner engagement
- Willingness to complete and replay activities
- Sustained attention during tasks
- Observable confidence in interaction

### 3. Navigation and flow
- Ability to move between screens without confusion
- Clarity of transitions between learning steps
- Reduction of friction observed in v2

### 4. Classroom fit
- Suitability of pacing within lesson time
- Alignment with how teachers introduce and manage activities
- Perceived readiness for structured classroom use

## Participants

- 10 students  
- 2 classroom teachers  

Testing was conducted through supervised classroom-style sessions and direct observation.

---

## Key Findings

Findings from Prototype Alpha v3 indicated that:

- Approximately 90 percent of students completed activities without adult assistance
- Average practice scores were around 78 percent
- Students demonstrated willingness to replay activities voluntarily
- Navigation and instructional clarity showed clear improvement over v2
- Teachers rated pedagogical clarity and classroom suitability at 4 out of 5 or higher
- Teachers confirmed that the activities were appropriate for early primary learners, including Grade 1

These results validated the Alpha prototype as **classroom-viable and engaging** at the activity and unit-entry level.

---

## Scope and Limitations

Prototype Alpha v3 deliberately did **not** test:
- Long-term learning outcomes
- Behavioural or wellbeing impacts
- Teacher dashboards or analytics
- Classroom sync or multi-user management
- Home learning workflows
- AI-assisted features

These elements were intentionally deferred to subsequent development and testing phases.

---

## Outcome of v3

Prototype Alpha v3 successfully validated:
- The core learning engine
- Child usability and autonomy
- Teacher-perceived classroom fit
- Readiness to progress beyond exploratory prototyping

As a result, the Alpha phase was formally closed and development progressed to **Prototype Pre-Beta**, focusing on platform integration, unit-level sequencing, and governed AI support.

## How v3 Fits in the Development Sequence

- **v1** — Conceptual and pedagogical validation  
- **v2** — Functional feasibility and offline usability  
- **v3** — Classroom usability and engagement validation (this stage)  

The Pre-Beta phase extends prototype testing to the **system level**, introducing PWA delivery, complete unit sequencing, and AI functionality under strict governance.
