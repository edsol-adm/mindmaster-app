# Prototype Alpha v3 — Testing Summary

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This document consolidates findings from **Prototype Alpha v3 testing**, the final iteration of the Alpha phase for PowerMind.

The purpose of v3 testing was to validate:
- Classroom usability of the Alpha prototype
- Instructional clarity for early primary learners
- Learner engagement during interactive activities
- Teacher-perceived suitability for real classroom use

This testing phase focused on **usability and feasibility**, not on measuring long-term learning outcomes or behavioural impact.

## 2. Testing Context

### Participants
- 10 students (primary level)
- 2 classroom teachers

### Testing format
- Supervised, classroom-style sessions
- Direct observation of student interaction
- Teacher feedback collected through post-session discussion
- Student responses gathered through simple, age-appropriate post-activity questionnaires

The prototype was used in short, structured sessions designed to simulate real classroom conditions without introducing additional system complexity.

## 3. Quantitative Signals (Aggregated)

The following quantitative indicators were observed during Alpha v3 testing. These figures are **descriptive usability signals**, not learning outcome claims.

### 3.1 Instructional independence
- Approximately **90 percent of students** were able to complete activities **without adult assistance**
- Student questionnaire responses and direct observation consistently indicated that **task instructions were easy to understand**, which aligns with the high rate of independent task completion

### 3.2 Practice performance
- **Average practice score across activities was approximately 78 percent**
- Scores suggested meaningful engagement with tasks rather than random guessing

### 3.3 Engagement behaviour
- Multiple students voluntarily **replayed activities** after completion
- Time-on-task was sustained across sessions without prompting
- Despite the prototype’s early-stage technical limitations, students generally demonstrated **willingness to continue engaging** with the activities

## 4. Qualitative Findings

### 4.1 Student interaction patterns
- Students showed increased confidence navigating tasks compared to earlier Alpha iterations
- Interaction patterns (tapping, selecting, sorting) were quickly learned and reused consistently
- Navigation-related confusion observed in v2 was significantly reduced in v3

### 4.2 Instructional clarity and accessibility
- On-screen instructions were generally understood on first exposure
- Language used within the activities was accessible to early primary learners
- Visual elements effectively supported comprehension and task completion
- Students were able to self-correct based on feedback without adult intervention

### 4.3 Perceived learning and articulation
- Students reported confidence in **explaining what they learned to peers**, suggesting early conceptual understanding appropriate for this stage
- Students indicated that learning felt relevant to school and peer interactions

### 4.4 Teacher observations
Teachers reported that:
- Activities were **pedagogically clear** and aligned with lesson intent
- Pacing was appropriate for structured classroom use
- The prototype could realistically be integrated into lessons with minimal additional explanation
- Activities were suitable for **early primary learners**, including Grade 1

## 5. Comparison to Earlier Alpha Iterations

Relative to Prototype Alpha v2, v3 demonstrated:
- Clear improvement in navigation clarity
- More coherent visual hierarchy
- Higher observable engagement
- Reduced need for adult clarification during task execution

These improvements confirm that feedback from earlier Alpha iterations was successfully incorporated into the v3 build.

## 6. Design Implications and Decisions

Findings from Alpha v3 testing informed the following decisions:

- The **core learning engine** is viable and should be retained
- Activity-level interaction design supports independent use by early primary learners
- Instructional and navigation patterns established in v3 form the baseline for subsequent development
- The prototype is ready to progress beyond exploratory Alpha testing

Areas intentionally deferred:
- Learning analytics and dashboards
- Classroom sync and multi-user management
- Home learning workflows
- AI-supported features
- Technical polish and performance optimisation

## 7. Scope and Limitations

Prototype Alpha v3 testing did **not** evaluate:
- Long-term learning gains
- Behavioural or wellbeing outcomes
- Comparative effectiveness versus other interventions
- Teacher workload reduction
- System performance at scale

These limitations are appropriate for the Alpha stage and are planned for subsequent phases.

## 8. Outcome and Next Phase

Prototype Alpha v3 successfully validated:
- Classroom usability
- Instructional clarity
- Learner engagement
- Teacher-perceived classroom fit

As a result, the Alpha phase was formally closed.

Subsequent development extends prototype testing to the **system level**, focusing on:
- Platform integration and delivery refinement
- Unit-level learning coherence
- Technical stability and performance
- AI functionality under strict governance
