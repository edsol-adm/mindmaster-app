# Prototype Alpha v1 — Concept & Pedagogy Validation

## Purpose of v1

Prototype Alpha v1 was an **exploratory, non-executable prototype** created to validate the *conceptual and pedagogical foundations* of PowerMind before investing in functional development.

At this stage, the goal was **not** to test software performance or usability in real classrooms, but to answer a more fundamental question:

> Can psychology literacy for early primary students be translated into a clear, age-appropriate digital learning experience without losing pedagogical integrity?

---

## What v1 Consisted Of

Prototype Alpha v1 included **design and pedagogy artefacts only**, not runnable software.

### 1. Static UI mockups
- Screen-level layouts for child-facing activities
- Early visual language (colour, typography, icon style)
- Draft navigation flow between lesson components
- Button placements and interaction affordances represented visually

### 2. Digital lesson storyboards
- Paper-based psychology literacy activities translated into screen sequences
- Early articulation of the Explore → Practice → Reflect learning flow
- Mapping of psychology concepts to concrete, child-friendly representations

### 3. Teacher-facing conceptual views
- Mocked representations of how teachers would introduce and guide activities
- Used solely for discussion and validation of classroom feasibility
- No live data, dashboards, or controls

---

## What v1 Did *Not* Include

To be explicit, Prototype Alpha v1 did **not** include:
- Executable code
- Interactive HTML activities
- Scoring logic or feedback systems
- Offline or online deployment
- User accounts or data persistence
- Analytics, dashboards, or AI components

These elements were intentionally deferred until the core pedagogy and design direction were validated.

## What Was Tested in v1

Testing at this stage focused on **qualitative validation**, not metrics.

### 1. Pedagogical clarity
- Could teachers understand the intended learning objective from the screens alone?
- Did the digital representation preserve the psychology teaching sequence?

### 2. Curriculum fidelity
- Were core psychology concepts accurately represented after digitisation?
- Was the sequencing developmentally appropriate for early primary learners?

### 3. Visual and cognitive appropriateness
- Age suitability of layouts, fonts, and iconography
- Cognitive load of individual screens
- Alignment with how young children process instructions visually

## Participants

- 2 classroom teachers  
- 2 curriculum / psychology experts  

Feedback was gathered through structured walkthroughs and discussion rather than classroom deployment.

---

## Key Outcomes and Decisions

Feedback from Prototype Alpha v1 confirmed that:

- The **psychology literacy approach translated well** into a digital format
- The proposed learning flow was **age-appropriate and pedagogically sound**
- Visual metaphors and screen sequencing supported understanding rather than confusion
- The concept justified investment in a **functional, offline-capable prototype**

As a result:
- The project advanced to **Prototype Alpha v2**, focused on building a minimal functional HTML prototype
- Offline-first delivery was prioritised for real classroom conditions
- Navigation and interaction design became the next testing focus

---

## Status of v1

Prototype Alpha v1 is **complete and closed**.

It is documented here for transparency and to demonstrate the iterative development process under a Rapid Application Development (RAD) approach.  
There is no executable build associated with v1.

## How v1 Fits in the Alpha Sequence

- **v1** — Conceptual and pedagogical validation (this stage)
- **v2** — Functional feasibility and offline usability testing
- **v3** — Engagement, instructional clarity, and classroom viability testing

The current contents of the `prototype-alpha/` root directory represent **Prototype Alpha v3**, which incorporates learnings from v1 and v2.
